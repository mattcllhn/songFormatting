		<text>Verse: 
[G]My one comfort both in life and death
Is that [C]I am not my [G]own
I was [G]bought with blood and I confess
I [C]belong to you [G]alone

Chorus: 
By the [Em]Father’s [C]good [G]decree
Jesus [Em]you’ve [C]delivered [G]me
By your [Em]spirit [C]set me [G]free
To [D]follow [G]you

Bridge: 
[C]Jesus you have taken hold of [G]me
And [C]in your grip of grace I’m finally [G]free
