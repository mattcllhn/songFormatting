Latin 1:
Personent hodie
Voces puerulae,
Laudantes iocunde
Qui nobis est natus,
Summo Deo datus,

Refrain:
Id-e-o-o-o, id-e-o-o-o, (I sing out, I sing out)
Id-e-o gloria in excelsis Deo! (I sing out, glory to God in the highest)

Verse 1: 
On this day earth shall ring
With the song children sing
To the Lord, Christ our King,
Born on earth to save us;
Him the Father gave us.

Refrain:
Id-e-o-o-o, id-e-o-o-o, (I sing out, I sing out)
Id-e-o gloria in excelsis Deo! (I sing out, glory to God in the highest)

Verse 2: 
On this day angels sing;
with their song earth shall ring,
praising Christ, heaven's King,
born on earth to save us;
peace and love he gave us.
