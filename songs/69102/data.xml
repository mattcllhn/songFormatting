Congregation:
For to us a child is born,
      to us a son is given;
And the government shall be upon his shoulder,
      and his name shall be called
Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
      Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
Of the increase of his government and of peace
      there will be no end,
on the throne of David and over his kingdom,
      to establish it and to uphold it
with justice and with righteousness
      from this time forth and forevermore.
The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.
