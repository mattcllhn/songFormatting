		<text>Verse 1: 
We were [C]ruined [Csus]in our [C]sin,{,} we were [C]guilty [Csus]and un[C]done
When Your [Em]love reached down{,} with[F] sovereign hands
And [Dm]beckoned us to [F]come
Verse 2: 
You sought [C]out the [Csus]wander[C]ers
Made the [C]prodi[Csus]gals come [C]home
With a [Em]lavish feast You [F]welcomed us
For [Dm]You made [G]us Your [D]own

Chorus: 
You have [G]loved [Am]us{,} [F]like You love Your [C     | C]Son
We are [G]heirs [Am]with [F]Christ,{,} bought by Hi[Dm7]s blood [G] 
[C/E]Oh how [G]great [Am]the [F]love{,} that we’ve been [C]shown
We’re Your [Dm  Em]children [F]now, You made us Your [C     | C]own

Verse 3: 
We are [C]strangers [Csus]to the [C]world
But no [C]strangers [Csus]to Your [C]throne
We draw [Em]near You now with [F]confidence
For [Dm]all our fears are [F]gone

Verse 4: 
And when [C]Christ our [Csus]King re[C]turns
We’ll meet [C]saints we’ve [Csus]never [C]known
And for[Em]ever we will [F]be amazed
That [Dm]You made [G]us Your [C]own</text>
