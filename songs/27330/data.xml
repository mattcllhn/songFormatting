		<text>VERSE 1: 
[(5/4)]How d[D]eep the Father’s [Em]love for [G]us
How [D/F#]vast beyond all [D/A]meas[A]ure
That [D]He should give His [Em]only S[G]on
To [D/F#]make a wretch His tr[A]eas[D]ure
How [D/F#]great the pain of [Em]searing l[G]oss
The [D/F#]Father turns His [Bm]face aw[A]ay
As [D]wounds which mar the C[Em]hosen [G]One
[(3/4)]Bring [D/F#]many sons to g[A]lor[| D]y        [| G/B          | D/A          | G2          |]

VERSE 2: 
[(5/4)]Be[D]hold the Man up[Em]on a c[G]ross
My [D/F#]sin upon His [D/A]should[A]ers
Ash[D]amed, I hear my [Em]mocking v[G]oice
Call [D/F#]out among the sc[A]off[D]ers
It [D/F#]was my sin that [Em]held Him th[G]ere
Un[D/F#]til it was acc[Bm]ompl[A]ished
His d[D]ying breath has br[Em]ought me l[G]ife
[(3/4)]I [D/F#]know that it is f[A]i-n[| D]ished        [| G/B          | D/A          | G2          |]

VERSE 3: 
[(5/4)]I [D]will not boast in [Em]anyth[G]ing
No [D/F#]gifts, no pow’r, no [D/A]wisd[A]om
But [D]I will boast in [Em]Jesus Chr[G]ist
His [D/F#]death and resurr[A]ect[D]ion
Why [D/F#]should I gain from [Em]His rew[G]ard?
I [D/F#]cannot give an [Bm]answ[A]er    
But [D]this I know with [Em]all my h[G]eart
[(3/4)]His [D/F#]wounds have paid my r[A]ans[| D]om       [| G/B         | D/A         | G2         |]
(Ending)                            [| D          | G2         | D         | G2         | D         |]</text>
