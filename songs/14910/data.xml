[||: F#m7      | A      | E      | D2      :||]

Verse 1:
[D]Jesus, I am [E]blind, be my [F#m    | A]light
[D]Darkened in my [E]mind, be my [F#m    | F#m]wisdom
[D]Bend my stubborn [E]will to Your [F#m    | A]own
[D]Open up my [E]ears to hear Your [F#m    | F#m]Spirit
Melt my [Bm]conscience once ag[A]ain, help me [Bm]hate the slightest [A]sin
And when [E]Satan comes to tempt me

Chorus:
I come [F#m]running to You, [A2] [ ]when I [E]fear, when I’m [D]tried
I come [F#m]running to You, [A2] [ ]to Your [E]blood, to Your [D]side
And [A]there my soul finds [Asus4]rest, [A]there my soul finds r[Asus4]est in [F#m | A2 | A2]You

Verse 2:
[D]Shepherd of my [E]soul, lead me [F#m    | A]on
[D]To the pastures [E]green in Your [F#m    | F#m]Scriptures
[D]Make me to lie [E]down by waters [F#m    | A]still
[D]Fill me with Your [E]peace in the [F#m    | F#m]tempest
I take my [Bm]refuge in Your [A]cross, by Your [Bm]sacrifice I’m [A]washed
And when [E]Satan comes accusing

Verse 3:
[D]Once I was Your [E]foe, a slave to [F#m    | A]sin
A [D]stranger to Your [E]love,{,} a hopeless [F#m    | F#m]outcast
But [D]You have brought me [E]near, I’m bought with [F#m    | A]blood
Now [D]I’m Your precious [E]child,{,} an heir with [F#m    | F#m]Jesus
You pour [Bm]heav’n into my [A]soul, Your wondrous [Bm]love, it overfl[A]ows
And I [E]marvel how You love me</text>
