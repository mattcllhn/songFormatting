[||: C       | G       | D       | Am       :||]

Verse 1:
We had [C]turned from God to [G]sin’s disgrace, we [D]chose the path to [Em]hell
Perfect [C]law of God con[G]demned our race, for [D]all in Adam [C]fell
But the [Em]righteousn[D/F#]ess of God appeared{,} an[G]d the world found h[C]ope again
For the [Em]Righteous One{,} has [D/F#]come down to bear{,}
All the [G]curse of sin and [C]death

Chorus:
Now to [D]Him Who's seated [G]on the throne, all [Em]glory [G]be for[C]ever
Oh, the [D]depths of wisdom, g[G]race, and power, all [Em]glory [G]be for[C]ever
All [Em]glory [G]be for[D (1x intro) (2x instrumental) (last time outro)]ever

Verse 2:
Every [C]bond of sin that [G]held us fast{,} is [D]left in Jesus’ [Em]grave
We’ve been [C]freed{,} from all that g[G]ripped our past
From [D]Satan’s rule and [C]reign
We’ve been [Em]raised to life{,} to [D/F#]breathe His grace
As c[G]aptives now recl[C]aimed
All our [Em]guilt is gone, all our [D/F#]strivings ceased,
We’re al[G]ive to seek His f[C]ame

INSTR.:
[C       | Em       | D       | Am       | C       | Em       | D       | Am       | C]

VERSE 3:
Now our f[C]uture’s fixed, our j[G]ourney clear; God [D]will not let us [Em]go
Every [C]trial that tempts our [G]hearts to fear{,} He’ll [D]use to give us [C]hope
All cre[Em]ation groans as [D/F#]we await{,} what our [G]eyes have longed to [C]see
Every [Em]pain and evil we’ve [D/F#]long endured
Will be [G]crushed by Christ our [C]King

OUTRO:
[C       | G       | D       | Am       | C       | Em       | D       | Am       | C]</text>
