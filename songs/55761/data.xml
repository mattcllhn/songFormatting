VERSE 1: 
[C] You will save whom Y[Csus]ou will save[C];{,} we're the lost and[Csus] helpless ones
[F] The rebels and the renegades{,} who spurned Your holy [G]love
[C] You will save whom Y[Csus]ou will save,[C] mercy will be [Csus]magnified
[F] Everyone has gone astray{,} and followed after [G]lies
 But You have [Dm]loved us and opened our [Gsus   G]eyes 

CHORUS: 
It's Your [F]grace [C] [ ]from begi[G]nning to the [Am]end
It's Your [F]grace;[C] [ ]we [G]will never co[Am]mprehend 
Why You [F]drew the ones who r[Am]an from You
What [Dm]can we do but [G]offer You praise?

VERSE 2: 
[C] You will save whom Y[Csus]ou will save;{,}[C] we were captive t[Csus]o our wills
[Dm] And if our hearts had [Am]not been changed{,} we'd [F]flee Your mercy [G]still
[C] You will save whom Y[Csus]ou will save;{,}[C] who can question w[Csus]hat You do?
[Dm] You're the potter, [Am]we're the clay;{,} You can [F]make us as You c[G]hoose
 And there is [Dm]no one who boasts before Y[Gsus]ou [G]
