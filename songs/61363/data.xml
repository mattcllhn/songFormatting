[F#m     | D     | A     | A    E/G#   (2x)]

VERSE 1:
O be[F#m]hold, the [D]mystery now un[A]folds [| A    E/G#]
See the [F#m]star [D]shine on the virgin fo[A]retold [| A    E/G#]
Angels [D]sing and light up the [A]sky
Hope rings [E]out in a newborn's [F#m]cry
Swing [B]wide, you ancient gates{,} for [D]Christ is born today!

Chorus:
Pre[A]pare Him [E]room, pre[F#m]pare Him [Dmaj7]room
Let the [A]King of [E]Glory enter [F#m]in [D]

VERSE 2:
God with [F#m]us,{,} the [D]promise has come to [A]be [| A    E/G#]
This, the [F#m]one{,} the [D]prophets were longing to [A]see [| A    E/G#]
In the [D]darkness a blazing [A]light,{,} to the [E]hungry the words of [F#m]life
His [B]kingdom now is near{,} for [D]those with ears to hear

Instr:
[B     | B     | D     | D     | B     | B     | D     | C#]

Verse 3:
Oh, our [F#m]hearts, as [D]busy as Bethle[A]hem [| A    E/G#]
Hear Him [F#m]knock, don't [D]say there's no room in the [A]inn [| A    E/G#]
Through the [D]cradle, cross, and [A]grave
See the [E]love of God dis[F#m]played
Now He's [B]risen and he reigns
Praise the [D]Name above all names!
