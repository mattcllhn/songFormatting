[||: F#m    A    | C       :||]

Verse 1:
You are [F#m]beautiful beyond desc[A]ription
Too [F#m7]marvelous for [A]words
Too [A]wonderful for comprehension
Like [Bm]nothing ever seen or [E]heard
Who can [F#m]grasp Your infinite w[E/G#]isdom?
Who can [A]fathom the depth of Your l[D6]ove?
You are [F#m7]beautiful beyond desc[A]ription
Majes[Bm7]ty enthr[E]oned a[F#m7    | F#m7   E/G#   |]bove.

Chorus:
[E/G#]And I [A]stand, I [E/A]stand in [D]awe of You
I [A]stand, I [E/A]stand in [D]awe of You
Holy [F#m]God to [E]whom all [Bm7]praise is due
I [D]stand in [E9]awe of [||: F#m   A   | C      :||]You.

Verse 2:
You are [F#m7]beautiful beyond desc[A]ription
Yet God [F#m7]crushed You for my [A]sin
In [A]agony and deep affl[A]iction
Cut [Bm]off that I might enter [E]in
Who can [F#m]grasp such tender com[E/G#]passion?
Who can f[A]athom this mercy so [D6]free?
You are [F#m7]beautiful beyond desc[A]ription
Lamb of [Bm]God who [E]died for [F#m7    E/G#]me.</text>
