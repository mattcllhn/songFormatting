[D/F#  |  G  |  D/A  |  Asus ]

VERSE 1:
Father, [D]I can come to [Asus]You and boast of [D/F#]deeds I've [G]done
In my [D]pride I strive to [Asus]earn the favor [D/F#]Christ has [G]won
He a[A]lone pleads my ac[G]ceptance, [D/F#]all my w[G]orks [D/F#]a - s[G]ide
So I [D]come with empty [Asus]hands and I [G]cling to [D]Christ. [| G | D/F# | A]

VERSE 2:
Father, [D]I can go a[Asus]stray and battle ne[D/F#]edless fea[G]rs
Voices [D]tell me I’m con[Asus]demned and that I c[D/F#]an’t draw n[G]ear
But Your [A]Spirit calls me [G]homeward [D/F#]with Your [G]words [D/F#]of   [G]life
Jesus [D]bore my every [Asus]sin, so, I [G]cling to C[D]hrist [| G]

BRIDGE:
It’s more than [Em]I can [Bm]do to keep my [G]hold on [A]You
But all my [Em]hope and [Bm]peace is that You [G]cling to [A]me
It’s more than [Em]I can [Bm]do to keep my [G]hold on [A]You
But all my [Em]hope and [Bm]peace is that You [G]cling to [A]me [| A]

VERSE 3:
Father, [D]all my earthly [Asus]aims in time will [D/F#]turn to [G]dust
Let me [D]learn that loss is [Asus]gain for those who [D/F#]know Your l[G]ove
All the [A]treasures of this [G]world will [D/F#]never [G]sa[D/F#]tis - [G]fy
You al[D]one are endless [Asus]joy, so I cl[G]ing to Ch[Bm7]rist [(to go to bridge: D)]

TO END: 
You al[D]one are endless [Asus]joy, so I cl[G]ing to C[D]hrist.
