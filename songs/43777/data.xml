VERSE 1:
[A]  I am a sinner, [C#m]  You’re blameless, Lord

[D]  Your laws demands it, [A]for You are [E]just

PRE-CHORUS:
If [D]You would count{,} everyth[A]ing that I’ve done wr[E]ong

But there’s forg[A]iveness with You, G[E]od

CHORUS:
Have [Bm7]mercy on m[D]e, have [A]mercy on [E]me
A [Bm7]broken and a contrite h[D]eart
You won’t turn aw[A]ay [E]
Have [Bm7]mercy on m[D]e, have [A]mercy on m[Bsus]e
Be[D]cause of Your [E]stead[A]fast l[Bm]ove [D   | A    E]
