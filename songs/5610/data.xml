		<text>Verse 1:
When we [C]walk with [G7]the [C]Lord, in the [G7]light of [F]His [C]Word,
What a [F]glory He [C]sheds on our [G7]way!
While we [C]do His [G7]good [C]will, He a[G7]bides with [F]us [C]still,
And with [F]all who will [C]trust and [G7]o[C]bey.


Chorus:
[G7]Trust and o[C]bey, for there’s [A]no other [Dm]way
To be [G]happy in [C]Jesus, but to [C/G]trust and [G7]o[C]bey.


Verse 2:
Not a [C]shadow [G7]can [C]rise, not a [G7]cloud in [F]the [C]skies,
But His [F]smile quickly [C]drives it a[G7]way;
Not a [C]doubt or [G7]a [C]fear, not a [G7]sigh or [F]a [C]tear,
Can a[F]bide while we [C]trust and [G7]o[C]bey.

Verse 3:
Not a [C]burden [G7]we [C]bear, not a [G7]sorrow [F]we [C]share,
But our [F]toil He doth [C]richly re[G7]pay;
Not a [C]grief or [G7]a [C]loss, not a [G7]frown or [F]a [C]cross,
But is [F]blessed if we [C]trust and [G7]o[C]bey.


Verse 4:
But we [C]never [G7]can [C]prove{,} the de[G7]lights of [F]His [C]love
Until [F]all on the [C]altar we [G7]lay;
For the [C]favor [G7]He [C]shows, for the [G7]joy He [F]be[C]stows,
Are for [F]them who will [C]trust and [G7]o[C]bey.


Verse 5:
Then in [C]fellow[G7]ship [C]sweet, we will [G7]sit at [F]His [C]feet.
Or we’ll [F]walk by His [C]side in the [G7]way.
What He [C]says we [G7]will [C]do, where He [G7]sends we [F]will [C]go;
Never [F]fear, only [C]trust and [G7]o[C]bey.</text>
