To [Em7]you who for [D]refuge to [G]Jesus [A]have [Bsus]fled?  [B] 
To [G]you who for [Bm7]refuge to [A7]Jesus have [D (intro)]fled?

Verse 3: 
&quot;When [D]through the deep waters{,} I [A]call you to [D]go,
The [D]rivers of sorrow{,} shall [G]not over[E]flow; [E7   A] 
For [G]I will be [D]with you,{,} your [Bm]troub[A]les to [G]bless,
And [Em7]sanctify [D]to you your [G]deepest [A]dist[Bsus]ress. [B]

&quot;When [D]through fiery trials{,} your [A]pathways shall [D]lie,
My [D]grace, all sufficient,{,} shall [G]be your sup[E]ply; [E7   A] 
The [G]flame shall not [D]hurt you;{,} I [Bm]on[A]ly de[G]sign
Your [Em7]dross to con[D]sume, and your [G]gold to [A]re[Bsus]fine. [B]

I [D]will not, I will not{,} de[G]sert to his [E]foes; [E7   A] 
That [G]soul, though all [D]hell{,} should en[Bm]dea[A]vor to [G]shake,
I’ll [Em7]never, no [D]never, no [G]never [A]for[Bsus]sake! [B]
