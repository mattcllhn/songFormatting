		<text>Verse 1: 
I have a [Bm]home eternal [C]home
But for [G]now I walk this broken w[D]orld

But You show [G]hope can rise
Ag[D]ain up from the [Gsus       G]grave


Chorus: 
Ab[Em]ide with [D]me ab[C6]ide with [G]me
Don't l[Em]et me [D]fall and [C6]don't let [G]go
[Em]Walk with [D]me and [C6]never [Em]leave  [G/B] 
Ever [Cmaj7]close God ab[D]ide with [Gsus]me  [G   Gsus   G] 


Verse 2: 
There in the [Bm]night Gethsema[C]ne
Before the cr[G]oss before the [D]nails

And bore [Gsus]      our shame   [G]
