[Dm     | Gm     | C     | Fsus   F]

VERSE 1: 
[Dm]  Father, how sweet must be the [Gm]pleasure
[C]  You find in Your eternal [Fsus]Son [F] 
[Dm]  For long before You made the [Gm]heavens
[C]  Both You and He rejoiced as [Fsus]one [F] 
[Eb]  And long before You formed the [Bb/D]angels
[Gm]  Before You [F/A]made the day[Bb] and night
[Dm]  Jesus ex[C/E]ulted in Your [Bb/F]presence [F] 
[Bb/D]  And He was[C] all of Your de[Dm]light [| Gm     | C     | Fsus    F] 

VERSE 2: 
[Dm]  Father, what love You’ve shown to [Gm]rebels
[C]  That You would send Your Son so [Fsus]dear [F] 
[Dm]  Into this world of grief and [Gm]trouble
[C]  To bring unworthy sinners [Fsus]near [F] 
[Eb]We’ll never fathom how it pained [Bb/D]You
[Gm]  When You sup[F/A]plied the offe[Bb]ring
[Dm]  To rescue [C/E]those who had dis[Bb/F]dained You [F] 
[Bb/D]  To watch Your [C]dear Son suffe[Dm]ring [| Gm    | C    | Fsus    F]

VERSE 3: 
[Dm]  Jesus, it fills our hearts with [Gm]wonder
[C]  That You would leave Your heavenly [Fsus]place [F] 
[Dm]  To take on flesh to thirst and [Gm]hunger
[C]  To save the ones who spurned Your [Fsus]grace [F] 
[Eb]  You came to forfeit every [Bb/D]mercy
[Gm]  To die that [F/A]mercy we [Bb]would find
[Dm]  And then You [C/E]hung alone in [Bb/F]darkness [F] 
[Bb/D]  So in our [C]hearts Your grace would sh[Dm]ine [| C    | Bb    | C] 

{key:Em}
VERSE 4: 
[Em]  Jesus, in glory You’ve a[Am]scended
[D]  Never again to leave Your [Gsus]throne [G]
[Em]  Because of You we are be[Am]friended
[D]  Received and welcomed as God’s [Gsus]own [G]
[F]  Father, how sweet now is Your [C/E]pleasure
[Am]  In us, Your [G/B]daughters and Your [D]sons
[Em]  We will [D/F#]delight in You for[C/G]ever  [G]
[D/F#]  In Jesus [D]You have made us [Am7]one
[C]  In Jesus [Dsus]You have made us [Em]one [ | Am/E      | D      | Gsus    G]</text>
