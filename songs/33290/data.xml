		<text>VERSE 1:
[Dm]What wond[Am]rous [C]love [Em]is [Dm]this,
[C]O my [Dm]soul! O my [C]soul!
[F]What [C]wond[Bm]rous [Am]love [G]is [Am]this, [G]O [C]my [Dm]soul!
[C]What [F]wond[C]rous [F]love [C]is [Dm]this
That [C]caused [Am]the [Bm7]Lord [C]of [Dm]bliss
To bear [Am]the d[Em]readful [Dm]curse,
[C]For my [Dm]soul, for my [C]soul,
[F]To [C]bear [Bm]the [Am]dread[G]ful [Am]curse, [G]for [C]my [Dm]soul.

VERSE 2:
When I was sinking down,
Sinking down, sinking down,
When I was sinking down, sinking down;
When I was sinking down,
Beneath God's righteous frown,
Christ laid aside his crown,
For my soul, for my soul,
Christ laid aside his crown, for my soul.

VERSE 3:
To God, and to the Lamb,
I will sing, I will sing,
To God, and to the Lamb, I will sing;
To God, and to the Lamb,
Unto the great I AM,
While millions join the theme,
I will sing, I will sing,
While millions join the theme, I will sing.

VERSE 4:
And when from death we're free,
We'll sing on, we'll sing on,
And when from death we're free, we'll sing on;
And when from death we're free,
We'll sing, and joyful be,
And through eternity
We'll sing on, we'll sing on,
And through eternity we'll sing on.
