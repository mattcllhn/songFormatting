[D     | Dsus     | D     | Dsus]

Verse 1:
[D]  God moves in a mys[Dsus]terious way,[D]  His wonders to per[Dsus]form
[D]  He plants His footsteps [Dsus]in the sea,[G]  and rides u[Bm]pon the[Asus]  storm
[Bm]  Deep in His dark and [G]hidden mines,[D/F#]  with never faili[Esus]ng [ ]skil[E]l
[Bm]  He fashions all His [D/A]bright designs,
[G/B]  And works His soverei[A/C#]gn will [| A]

Chorus:
So [G]God we [D/F#]trust in [Em7    | Em7    |]You
O [G]God we [D/F#]trust in [Em7    | G    |]You

Verse 2:
[D]  O fearful saints new [Dsus]courage take,[D]  the clouds that you now [Dsus]dread
[D]  Are big with mercy [Dsus]and will break,[G]  in blessings [Bm]on your [A] [ ]head
[Bm]  Judge not the Lord by [G]feeble sense,[D/F#]  but trust Him for Hi[Esus]s gra[E]ce
[Bm]  Behind a frowning [D/A]providence,[G/B]  He hides a smiling[A/C#] [ ]face [| A    |]

Chorus:
So [G]God we [D/F#]trust in [Em7   | Em7   |]You
O [G]God we [D/F#]trust in [Em7   | A]You
When tears are [C2]great and comforts [G/B]few
We hope in [Em9]mercies ever [Asus]new
We trust in [D     | Dsus     | D     | Dsus     | D     | Dsus     | D     | Dsus     |]You

Verse 3:
[D]  God’s purposes will [Dsus]ripen fast,[D]  unfolding every [Dsus]hour
[D]  The bud may have a [Dsus]bitter taste,[G]  but sweet will [Bm]be the [Asus] [ ]flower
[Bm]  Blind unbelief is [G]sure to err,[D/F#]  and scan His work in[Esus] [ ]vai[E]n
[Bm]  God is His own in[D/A]terpreter,[G/B]  and He will make it [A/C#] [ ]plain</text>
