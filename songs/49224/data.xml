		<text>Verse 1: 
[A]Standing on this mountaintop
[E]Looking just how far we’ve come
[F#m7]Knowing that for every step
[D]You were with us

Verse 2: 
[A]Kneeling on this battle ground
[E]Seeing just how much You’ve done
[F#m]Knowing every victory
Was [D2]Your power in us

Pre-Chorus:
[D2]Scars and struggles on the way
[E4]But with joy our hearts can say
[A/C#]Yes, our hearts can [D]say

Chorus: 
[A]Never once did we ever walk alone
[F#m7] Never once did You leave us on our own
[D2] You are [A]faithful, [F#m]God, You are [E]faithful
[D2] You are [A]faithful, [F#m]God, You are [E]faithful
