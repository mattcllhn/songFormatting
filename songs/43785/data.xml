		<text>INTRO:
[F#m      | F#m      | Dmaj7      | Bm]

VERSE 1:
A wasted [F#m]life, a brutal death, to the [C#m]blind a tragic story
For they [E]could not see{,} God’s glory was [Bm7]on display
Yet beauti[F#m]ful to all the ones, given [C#m]eyes to see the Savior
Objects [E]of the Father’s favor, bought [Bm7]by His grace
[E]Hope of all the earth and [E]our salvation

CHORUS:
[A]Lift high the [F#m7]cross
Here is the [D]Father’s love{,} re[Bm7]vealed to us
[A]Lift high the [F#m7]cross
Proclaim to a [D]dying world
There’s [Bm7]life in Jesus Christ [F#m   | F#m   | Dmaj7   | Bm]

VERSE 2:
Now You’ve en[F#m]abled us to be, hands that [C#m]reach out to the broken
With the [E]love that makes hearts open, and [Bm7]come to life
So by Your [F#m]power may our lives, like the [C#m]moon reflect Your radiance
Be a s[E]weet and holy fragrance{,} re[Bm7]vealing Christ
[D]Hope of all the earth and [E]our salvation

BRIDGE:
[E]  There is no other name
[A/C#]  By which we can be saved
[D]  Only Jesus, [Bm]   only Jesus
(Repeat)</text>
