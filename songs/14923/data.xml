		<text>Verse 1:
[G]Alas! and [G/B]did my [C]Savior [Dsus   D]bleed?
And [Em]did my [D]Sovereign [C]die?
Would [G/B]He dev[C]ote that [Dsus4]sa[D]-cred [Em]head
For [Am7]such a worm as [Dsus4  D]I?
Was [G]it for [G/B]sins that [C]I had [Dsus4  D]done,
He [Em]groaned up[D]on the [C]tree?
Am[G/B]azing [C]pity! [Dsus4  D]Grace unkn[Em]own!
And [Am7]love bey[Dsus4  D]ond degr[Gsus4 G]ee!

Chorus:
My [Bm]God, why would You [Em]shed Your blood
So [Am7]pure and undef[Dsus4  D]iled
To [Bm]make a sinful [C]one like [G/B]me
Your [Am7]chosen, [Dsus4  D]precious [C    | G/B    | Am7    | Dsus4  D | (G) |]child.

Verse 2:
Well [G]might the [G/B]sun in [C]darkness [Dsus4  D]hide
And [Em]shut His [D]glories [C]in
When [G/B]Christ, the [C]mighty [Dsus4  D]Maker, [Em]died
For [Am7]man the creature’s [Dsus4  D]sin
Thus [G]might I [G/B]hide my [C]blushing [Dsus4  D]face,
While [Em]His dear [D]cross ap[C]pears
Dis[G/B]solve my [C]heart in [Dsus4  D]thankful[Em]ness
And [Am7]melt my [Dsus4  D]eyes to [Gsus4  G]tears.</text>
