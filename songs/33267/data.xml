		<text>VERSE 1: 
Jer[G]usalem behold, as pr[Em7]ophecy foretold
Your King of glory c[C2]omes, your King of glory comes
He [G]rides in on a foal 
Your red[Em7]emption as his goal
Your King of glory c[C2]omes, with mercy now he comes  

CHORUS: 
How [G]great is our God!
Sing with me: How [Em7]great is our God!
And all will see how [Cmaj7]great, how g[D]reat is our G[G2]od!

VERSE 2: 
The [G]Son of God arrives, as the [Em7]Son of Man to die
The crowd lifts up a sh[C2]out, “Hosanna, King!” they shout
The c[G]hildren all rejoice! If [Em7]they would have no voice
The rocks would all cry [C2]out, the rocks would all cry out, 

BRIDGE: 
[G]Name above all names, [Em7]worthy of all praise
My [Cmaj7]heart will sing: How g[D]reat is our [G]God
