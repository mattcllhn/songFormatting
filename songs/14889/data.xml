Verse 1:
Shall I [Am]take from Your [G/B]hand Your b[C2]lessings
Yet not [Am]welcome [G/B]any p[C2]ain
Shall I [Am]thank You for [G/B]days of su[C2]nshine
Yet [G/B]grumble in days of r[D]ain
Shall I [Am]love You in [G/B]times of [C2]plenty
Then [Am]leave You in [G/B]days of dr[C2]ought
Shall I [Am]trust when I [G/B]reap a h[C2]arvest
But when [G/B]winter winds blow, then [D]doubt

Chorus:
Oh [G]let Your [Am7]will be [G/B]done in [C2]me, in Your [G]love I [Am7]will a[Dsus]bide [D]
Oh I [G]long for [Am7]nothing [G/B]else as [C2]long
As [G]You are [D]glori[G]fied [Am7    | Em    C2    | G    D    | G]

Verse 2:
Are You [Am]good only [G/B]when I pr[C2]osper
And [Am]true only [G/B]when I'm fi[C2]lled
You are [Am]King only [G/B]when I'm ca[C2]refree
And [G/B]God only when I'm [D]well
You are [Am]good when I'm [G/B]poor and [C2]needy
You are [Am]true when I'm parched and [C2]dry
You're still [G/B]God in the darkest [D]night
