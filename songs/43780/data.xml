[A    | D    | F#m7    | E    (2X)]

You spoke and our [A]hearts began to beat
You gave us [F#m7]breath and air to breathe
It’s all from [D2]You, Lord, it’s all from [A]You
You give the m[A]orning sun its light
All that we [Bm]need Your [F#m7]hand provides
It’s all from [D2]You, Lord, it’s all from [A]You
With humble [D2]hearts we thank You, 
With grateful [Esus]hearts we sing out
CHORUS:
Generous [A]King, You [D2]give
Out of Your [A/C#]fullness,{,} showering [E]kindness
You give,[A]  generous [D2]King,{,} mercies un[A/C#]ending
Love never [E]failing, You [A]give [| D    | F#m7    | E    | A]
VERSE 2:
The wrath we de[F#m7]served was furious
The cup that we [E]drink is full of love
It’s all from [D2]You, Lord, it’s all from [A]You
Your Spirit You’ve fr[A]eely given us
Now we see [Bm]Jesus glo[F#m7]rious
It’s all from [D2]You, Lord, it’s all from [A]You
With humble [D2]hearts we thank You
With grateful [Esus]hearts we sing out
