Verse 1: 
I once was [A]lost in darkest [Bm]night, yet thought I [G2]knew the [Bm]way:
The sin that [Em]promised joy and [G]life had led me [A]to the [D]grave.
I had no [D/F#]hope that You would [G]own a rebel [Em]to Your [Bm]will,
And if You [D/F#]had not loved me [G]first, I would re[Bm]fuse You [A]still

Verse 2: 
But as I [A]ran my hell-bound [Bm]race, indifferent [G]to the [Bm]cost,
You looked u[Em7]pon my helpless [G]state and led me [A]to the [D]cross.
And I be[D/F#]held God’s love disp[G]layed: You suffered [Em]in my [Bm]place,
You bore the [D/F#]wrath reserved for [G]me; now all I [Bm]know is [A]grace!

Chorus:
Halle[G]lu[D]jah! All I [A]have is [Bm]Christ!
Halle[G]lu[Bm]jah! Jesus [A]is my [D]life!

Verse 3: 
Now, Lord, I [A]would be Yours a[Bm]lone and live so [G]all might [D]see
The strength to [Em]follow Your com[Gmaj7]mands
Could never [A]come from [D]me
Oh Father, [D]use my ransomed [Dadd6]life in any way You [Dmaj7]choose,
And let my [Bm]song forever [G]be &quot;My[G/A] only b[Bm]oast is [A]You!&quot;</text>
