		<text>
I believe in God the Father Almighty,
Maker of heaven and earth;
And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord:
Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
Born of the Virgin Mary,
Suffered under Pontius Pilate,
Was crucified, dead and buried;
The third day he rose from the dead;
He ascended into heaven 
And sits at the right hand 
Of God the Father Almighty;
From there he shall come 
To judge the living and the dead.
I believe in the Holy Spirit, 
The holy catholic church, 
The communion of saints, 
The forgiveness of sins, 
The resurrection of the body, 
And the life everlasting.  

Amen.
