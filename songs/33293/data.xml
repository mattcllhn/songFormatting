		<text>VERSE 1: 
O Lord my [C]God! When I in [F]awesome wonder 
Consider [C]all the [G]worlds Thy [F]hands have [C]made.

Thy power through-[C]out the [G]uni[F]verse [C]displayed.

How great Thou [G]art,[F]how great Thou [C]art![Csus][C][Csus] 

VERSE 2: 
When through the [C]woods, and forest [F]glades I wander
And hear the [C]birds sing [G]sweetly [F]in the [C]trees,
When I look [C]down from lofty [F]mountain grandeur,
And hear the [C]brook, and [G]feel the [F]gentle [C]breeze;

VERSE 3: 
And when I [C]think that God, His [F]Son not sparing, 
Sent Him to [C]die, I [G]scarce can [F]take it [C]in; 
That on the [C]cross, my burden [F]gladly bearing, 
He bled and [C]died to [G]take [F]away my [C]sin: 

VERSE 4: 
When Christ shall [C]come with shout of [F]acclamation 
And take me [C]home, what [G]joy shall [F]fill my [C]heart! 
Then I shall [C]bow in humble [F]adoration, 
And there [C]proclaim, my [G]God. how [F]great Thou [C]art! </text>
