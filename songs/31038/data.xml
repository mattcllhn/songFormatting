[D2    Gmaj9     D2    Gmaj9]

Verse 1: 
My [D2]soul finds rest in [Gmaj7/B]God alone 
My [D2]rock and my [Bm7  A]salvation
A [D2]fortress strong [Gmaj7/B]against my foes 
And [D2]I will [Bm7]not be [A  D2]shaken
Though [Gmaj9]lips may bless and [D2]hearts may curse 
And [G]lies like arrows [Asus]pierce [A]me
I’ll [D2]fix my heart on [Gmaj7/B]righteousness 
I’ll [D2]look to [Bm7]Him who [A]hears [D2]me

Chorus: 
[A]O praise Him, [D2/F#     Gmaj9]hallelujah 
My [D2]delight and my [Gmaj9]reward
[     A]Everlasting, [D/F#]never [Gmaj9]failing 
My [      Em9]Redeemer, [A]my    [D2]God  

Verse 2: 
Find [D2]rest my soul in [Gmaj7/B]God alone 
[D2]Amid the world’s [       Bm7   A]temptation
[D2]When evil seeks to [Gmaj7/B]take a hold 
I’ll [D2]cling to [Bm7]my [    A    D2]salvation
Though [Gmaj9]riches come and [D2]riches go 
Don’t [G]set your heart [    Asus    A]upon them
The [D2]fields of hope in [       Gmaj7/B]which I sow 
Are [D2       Bm7]harvested in [A      D2]heaven

{new_page}
Verse 3: 
I’ll [D2]set my gaze on [Gmaj7/B]God alone
And [D2]trust in Him [       Bm7   A]completely
[D2]With every day pour [Gmaj7/B]out my soul 
And [D2]He will [Bm7]prove [    A    D2]His mercy
Though [Gmaj9]life is but a [D2]fleeting breath 
A [G]sigh too deep to [Asus   A]measure
My [D2]King has crushed [Gmaj7/B]the curse of death 
And [D2       Bm7]I am His [A      D2]forever

Bridge: 
O [Gmaj9]praise Him O [Bm7]praise Him
[          Asus]Hallelujah! [           Gmaj9]Hallelujah!
