		<text>Verse 1: 
[G]There is a hill I [C    G]cherish
[Em]Where stood a precious [D]tree
[Em]The emblem of [C    G]Salvation
[G/B]The gift of [D    G]Calvary

Verse 2: 
[G]How is it I should [C      G]profit?
[Em]While He is [       D]crucified
[Em]Yet as His life was [C   G]taken
[G/B]So I was [D]granted [G]mine

Chorus: 
[G]My wealth is in the [C]cross
There's [G]nothing more I [D]want
Than [Em]just to know His [C]love
My [G]heart is set on [D]Christ
And I will [Em]count all else as [C]loss
The [G]greatest of my [D]crowns
Mean [Em]nothing to me [C]now
For I've [G]counted up the [D]cost
And all my wealth is in the [Gsus      G]cross

Verse 3: 
[G]I will not boast in [C      G]riches
[Em]I have no pride in [D]gold
[Em]But I will boast in [C    G]Jesus
[G/B]And in His [D]Name [G]alone


Verse 4: 
[G]And when I stand in [C    G]glory
[Em]My crowns before the [D]Lord
[Em]Let this be my [     C    G]confession
[G/B]My wealth is [D]in the [G]cross</text>
