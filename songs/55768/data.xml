[||: G      | D      | A      |       :||]

Verse 1:
O holy J[G]udge, here is my [D]heart;{,} what can I [A]say to You?
Where could I [G]run, how could I [D]hide? Darkness is [A]day to You
The heart of a [Em]man is a maze with[D/F#]in
So, come, light the [G]way, illuminate [A]sin
Nothing’s con[G]cealed, all is re[D]vealed;{,} Jesus, I [A]yield to [D]You

Chorus:
Judge of the [G]secrets of the hearts of [D]men
Here I sur[G]render and humbly rep[D]ent [| A]
You've conquered my [Bm]soul;{,} [|]  [G]  now be its de[D]fense [| A]
Judge of the s[G]ecrets of the [A]hearts of [(1x intro) (2x instrumental)]men

Verse 2:
I was cond[G]emned under Your [D]law;{,} rightly, I [A]stood accused
I felt my [G]need, my conscience a[D]greed, I was with[A]out excuse
So how can I j[Em]udge the ones who f[D/F#]all?
I know in my [G]heart I’m just like them [A]all
I will conf[G]ess: my righteous[D]ness, Jesus, must [A]rest in [D]You

Instr.:
[||: G     | A     | Bm     | A/C#     | G     | A     | Em7     | F#m7     :||]

Tag:
O holy J[G]udge, here is my [D]heart

I know I’m [A]safe with [G]You [(intro to end)]</text>
