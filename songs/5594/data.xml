[F]What a friend we have in [Bb]Jesus, [F]all our sins and griefs to [C]bear!
[F]What a privilege to [Bb]carry{,} [F]every[C]thing to God in [F]prayer.
[C]O what peace we often [F]forfeit, [Bb]O what [F]needless pain we [C]bear,
[F]All because we do not [Bb]carry{,} [F]ev'ry[C7]thing to God in [F]prayer.


Verse 2:
[F]Have we trials and temp[Bb]tations? [F]Is there trouble any[C]where?
[F]We should never be dis[Bb]couraged, [F]take it [C]to the Lord in [F]prayer.
[C]Can we find a friend so [F]faithful{,} [Bb]who will [F]all our sorrows [C]share?
[F]Jesus knows our every [Bb]weakness, [F]take it [C7]to the Lord in [F]prayer.
