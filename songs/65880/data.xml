		<text>VERSE 1:
Come, [Bm]Holy Spirit, my s[G]oul assure
Re[D/A]lieve my fears that [A]I no more
May [Bm]doubt the love of [G]Christ for me
That my [D/A]debt is paid, that I’ve [A]been made free
O [Bm]Comforter, in [G]me reside
When the [D/A]tempter speaks, be my [A]faithful guide
Show Your [Bm]promise is for [G]me secured
For the [D/A]battle be my [A]heavenly sword


CHORUS:
Blessed as[G]surance, [Bm]     Jesus is [A]  mine!
Oh, what a [G]foretaste [Em]      of glory d[Bm]ivine! [A]
Heir of sal[G]vation, [Bm]      purchase of [A]  God
Born of His [G]Spirit, [Em]     washed in His [D]  blood


VERSE 2:
Il[Bm]lumine me with the [G]Savior’s light
To dis[D/A]pel my thoughts in the [A]blackest night
In [Bm]darkest hour to my [G]soul reveal
The [D/A]wounds which all my [A]sorrows heal
Imp[Bm]ress that seal, His [G]image leave
And [D/A]by Your pow'r to His [A]grace I’ll cleave
Until [Bm]faith be sight and [G]prayer be praise
When be[D/A]holding Jesus [A]face to face


BRIDGE:
[G]This my story, [D]this my song: [A]born of Spirit, [Bm]washed in blood
[G]This my story, [D]this my song: [A]in my Savior, I[Bm] belong
