		<text>Verse 1:
Lo, how a rose e'er blooming, 
From tender stem hath sprung!
From Jesseâ€™s lineage coming, 
As men of old have sung.
It came, a floweret bright, 
Amid the cold of winter
When half spent was the night.

Verse 2:
Isaiah 'twas foretold it, 
The Rose I have in mind
With Mary we behold it, 
The Virgin mother kind
To show God's love aright, 
She bore to us a Savior
When half spent was the night.

Verse 3:
The shepherds heard the story 
Proclaimed by angels bright,
How Christ, the Lord of Glory 
Was born on earth this night.
To Bethlehem they sped
And in the manger they found him,
As angels heralds said.

Verse 4:
This Flower, whose fragrance tender
With sweetness fills the air,
Dispels with glorious splendor
The darkness everywhere;
True man, yet very God,
From Sin and death he saves us,
And lightens every load.

Verse 5:
O Savior, Child of Mary, 
Who felt our human woe,
O Savior, King of glory, 
Who dost our weakness know;
Bring us at length we pray, 
To the bright courts of heaven,
And to the endless day!</text>
