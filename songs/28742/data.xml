		<text>VERSE 1:
Am[D]azing grace, how s[G/D]weet the s[D]ound
That saved a wretch like [A/D]me
I [D]once was [D/F#]lost, but n[G]ow I’m f[D]ound
T’was blind, but n[A/D]ow I s[D]ee

VERSE 2:
T’was gr[D]ace that taught my h[G/D]eart to f[D]ear
And grace my fears rel[A/D]ieved
How pr[D]ecious [D/F#]did that gr[G]ace app[D]ear
The hour I f[A/D]irst bel[D]ieved 

CHORUS:
My ch[D/F#]ains are g[G]one, I’ve been set f[D/F#]ree 
My God, my S[G]avior has ransomed [D/A]me 
And [D/F#]like a fl[G]ood His mercy r[D/F#]eigns 
Unending l[Em]ove, am[A7]azing gr[D]ace

VERSE 3:
The L[D]ord has promised g[G/D]ood to [D]me
His word my hope sec[A/D]ures  
He w[D]ill my sh[D/F#]ield and p[G]ortion b[D]e
As long as [A/D]life end[D]ures 

VERSE 4:
The [D]earth shall soon diss[G/D]olve like sn[D]ow
The sun forbear to sh[A/D]ine  
But G[D]od who [D/F#]called me h[G]ere bel[D]ow
Will be for[A/D]ever m[D]ine 
Will be for[A/D]ever m[D]ine 
Will be for[A/D]ever m[D]ine
