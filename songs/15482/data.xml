[G]You are the p[A/G]erfect and r[G]ighteous [A/G]God
Whose p[Bb]resence [C]bears no s[Gsus]in  [G]
[G]You bid me c[A/G]ome to Your h[G]oly p[A/G]lace
How c[Bb]an I e[C]nter [Dsus]in [D]
When Your p[Bb]resence [C]bears no s[Dsus]in? [D]
Through H[Em]im, who poured out His l[C7]ife for me
The at[D]oning Lamb of G[Asus]od [A]
Through H[Em7]im, and His work al[C2]one I boldly [F]co[F/E]me [Dsus]

Chorus:
I c[D]ome by the b[C]lood, I come by the c[G/B]ross
Where Your mercy f[Am]lows from [G]hands pierced for [D/F#]me
For [D]I dare not s[C]tand on my righteousn[Em]ess
My every hope r[Fmaj7]ests on w[Em]hat Christ has d[Dsus]one
And I c[D]ome by the b[G]lood

Verse 2:
[G]You are the h[A/G]igh and ex[G]alted K[A/G]ing
The O[Bb]ne the [C]angels f[Gsus]ear [G]

Lord, h[Bb]ow can [C]I draw n[Dsus]ear [D]
To the O[Bb]ne the a[C]ngels f[Dsus]ear? [D]
Through H[Em]im who laid down His l[C7]ife for me
And asc[D]ended to Your s[Asus]ide [A]
Through H[Em7]im, through Jesus al[C2]one I boldly [F]co[F/E]me [Dsus]
