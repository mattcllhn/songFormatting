		<text>VERSE 1: 
The sp[G]lendor of the King
Cl[Em7]othed in poverty
The angels all rej[C2]oice, the angels all rejoice
He wr[G]aps Himself in man 
The [Em7]ancient saving plan        
Begins now to unf[C2]old, begins now to unfold 

CHORUS: 
How gr[G]eat is our God!
Sing with me: How g[Em7]reat is our God!
And all will see how [Cmaj7]great, how gr[D]eat is our G[G2]od!

VERSE 2: 
Come m[G]arvel at His ways
The [Em7]Ancient of all Days
Becomes a mortal m[C2]an, becomes a mortal man
Beh[G]old this awesome grace
Our [Em7]God dies in our place
The Lion becomes the L[C2]amb, the Lion becomes the Lamb [to Chorus]
