		<text>Verse 1: 
[A/C#]   Deliverer You brought us out of the miry clay
[D2]   You set our feet upon the rock and You made us [A/C#]say 
Holy is the L[D2]ord
[A/C#]   We would declare Your thoughts about us and one by one
[D2]   It'd be too many to count so we simply c[A/C#]ome
And sing of Your great l[D2]ove
So we s[E]ing
We lift our hands and s[D2]ing

Chorus: 
You are w[A]orthy of affection
You're the r[D2]adiance of all of His glory
[A]   Let adoration fill this p[D2]lace
You hold [A]ev'rything together
By the W[D2]ord of Your immovable power
[A]   We sing a song of pr[D2]aise  [A    D2] 

[Repeat]      ([A]We sing) a song of pr[D]aise)   [A] 

Verse 2: 
[A/C#]   We are the broken down and we are the beaten up
[D2]   But what can stop us from a song of unending l[A/C#]ove
Holy is the L[D2]ord 
[A/C#]   You are the treasure the hope the bright and morning star
[D2]   You are the lover of our soul and You've won our h[A/C#]earts
We sing of Your great l[D2]ove
So we s[E]ing we lift our hands and s[D2]ing
