		<description>Alternate last verse</description>
		<text>Verse 1:
May the Lord be your delight
May he be the brightest light
That your heart-eyes ever see
For seeing him will set you free
From seeking joy in dying things
And satisfy your soul’s longings
Child I pray the Lord will be
The brightest light you ever see

Verse 2:
May your gracious Father show
Mercy on you as you grow
And incline your youthful heart
To love him from the very start
And to believe his promises
Are true despite what Satan says
Child I pray the Lord will show
Great mercy on you as you grow

Verse 3:
May he make you strong and bold
So that when you’re very old
You’ll recall how God kept you
From loving sin and saw you through
Some painful trials and let you see
Some mighty kingdom victories
Child I pray as you grow old
The Lord will make you strong and bold.

Verse 4:
May the Lord be your delight
May your heart-eyes see the light
Shining bright in Jesus’ face
His deep, deep love, his lavish grace
For on the cross he died to pay
For all your sins and make a way
So, child, he can eternally
Give joy to you and set you free.</text>
