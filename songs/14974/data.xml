		<text>Verse 1:
[C]In my [Dm]heart there [Bb]is a [F]stirring

A love to [Dm]worship [Bb]my Cre[F]ator
To show His [Bb]love for [C]all to [F]see

Chorus:
I will [C]worship, I will [Dm]honor
I will ex[Bb]alt the Lord ab[C]ove
All my [Dm]days, I’ll [Bb]sing the [C]praises
Of His [Bb]great re[C]deeming [F    Bb | Dm    | Dm    Bb | C]love.

Verse 2:
[C]In my [Dm]heart there [Bb]is a [F]treason
One that [Dm]poisons [Bb]all my [C]love
Take my [Dm]heart and [Bb]conse[F]crate it
Wash it [Bb]in Your [C]cleansing [F]blood.

Verse 3:
Tie me [Dm]to the [Bb]Rock un[F]changing
Tie me [Dm]to His [Bb]wondrous [C]cross
I’ll fix my [Dm]eyes up[Bb]on the [F]Savior
All other [Bb]things I [C]count as [F]loss.</text>
