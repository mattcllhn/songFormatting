Intro - G C D

In Christ a[G]lone my [C]hope is [D]found,
[G]He is my [C]light my [D]strength my [G]song.
This [C]corner[G]stone, this [C]solid [D]ground,
[G]firm through the [C]fiercest [D]drought and [G]storm.
what heights of [C]love, what [G]depths of [D]peace,
when [G]fears are [C]stilled, when [G]strivings [D]cease!
My [C]Comfor[G]ter my [C]All in [D]All,
[G]here in the [C]love of [D]Christ I [G]stand.


In [C]Christ a[G]lone, who [C]took on [D]flesh
[G]fullness of [C]God in [D]helpless [G]babe!
This [C]gift of [G]love and [C]righteous[D]ness,
[G]scorned by the [C]ones he [D]came to [G]save.
till on that [C]cross where [G]Jesus [D]died,
the [G]wrath of [C]God was [G]satis[D]fied.
for [C]every [G]sin on [C]Him was [D]laid;
[G]here in the [C]death of [D]Christ I [G]live.

{new_page}
There [C]in the [G]ground His [C]body [D]lay, 
[G]Light of the [C]world in [D]darkness [G]slain. 
Then [C]bursting [G]forth in [C]glorious [D]day,
[G]up from the [C]grave He [D]rose a[G]gain!
And as He [C]stands in [G]victo[D]ry,
sins [G]curse has [C]lost it's [G]grip on [D]me.
for [C]I am [G]His and [C]He is [D]mine, 
[G]bought with the [C]precious [D]blood of [G]Christ.

No [C]guilt in [G]life, no [C]fear in [D]death; 
[G]this is the [C]pow'r of [D]Christ in [G]me. 
From [C]life's first [G]cry to [C]final [D]breath,
[G]Jesus com[C]mands my [D]desti[G]ny. 
No pow'r of [C]hell, no [G]scheme of [D]man, 
can [G]ever [C]pluck me [G]from His [D]hand, 
till [C]He ret[G]urns or [C]calls me [D]home;
[G]here in the [C]pow'r of [D]Christ I'll [G]stand



[G]Here in the [C]pow'r of [D]Christ I'll [G]stand
