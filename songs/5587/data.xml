[A]They [D]looked [F#m]up and [G]saw a [D]star
Shining [G]in the [D]East be[A]yond them [D]far
[A]And [D]to the [F#m]earth it [G]gave great [D]light
And [G]so it con[D]tinued both [A]day and [D]night.
[A]No[D]el, No[F#m]el, No[G]el, No[D]el, [Bm]born is the [F#m G]King [Em]of [D/F#]Is[A]ra[D]el.

Verse 3: 
[A]And [D]by the [F#m]light of [G]that same [D]star,
Three [G]wise men [D]came from [A]country [D]far;
[A]To [D]seek for a [F#m]King was [G]their in[D]tent,
And to [G]follow the [D]star wher[A]ever it [D]went.
[A]No[D]el, No[F#m]el, No[G]el, No[D]el, [Bm]born is the [F#m G]King [Em]of [D/F#]Is[A]ra[D]el.

Verse 4: 
[A]Then [D]let us [F#m]all with [G]one ac[D]cord
Sing [G]praises [D]to our [A]heavenly [D]Lord
[A]That [D]hath made [F#m]Heaven and [G]earth of [D]nought
And [G]with his [D]blood man[A]kind has [D]bought.
