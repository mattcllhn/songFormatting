		<text>Verse 1:
[A]     History split by sacrifice

[E]     Paying the price justice demands

PRE-CHORUS:
[D]     As He was broken [C#m7]      heaven was opened
[Bm7]     Our judgment lifted [E]    our sins acquitted
[D]     His loving kindness [C#m]    freely invites us
[Bm7]     Into the realms of gr[E]ace

S[A]ing a new song sing of His goo[D]dness, sing of His goodness
[F#m7]Sing of His won[E]derful l[D]ove   [A]

Verse 2:
[A]     True love was shown true love defined
[Asus]     As He was scorned and crucified
[F#m7]     He tore the veil bridged the divide
[E/B]     Taking us from darkness to light

Chorus 2:
