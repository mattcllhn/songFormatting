INTRO: 
[C6 Em | D Bm | C6 G | D Bm7 | C6 Em | D Bm | C G | D]
VERSE1:
Your [G]Spirit had awakened our li[Gmaj7]feless hearts to see
The [G6]King in brilliant glory, rev[C/G]ealed in majesty
We were [G]ruined in Your p[D]resence and [Em]tearing at the s[C]eams
Our [G]eyes had gazed upon the King of k[D]ings

CHORUS:
We [C6]fall [Em]down in [D]awe of You [Bm7]
We [C6]fall [G]down un[D]done   [Bm7]
We [C]fall [Em]down be[D]fore you, Lord, [Bm7]      u[C]ndone[G]      [| D]

VERSE 2:
Our [G]hands had crafted idols, our [Gmaj7]lips had spoken lies
[G6]Every wayward thought we had a[C/G]gainst us testified
But [G]You were rich in [D]mercy
To prov[Em]ide what You de[C]mand
And [G]now on Christ, the solid rock, we s[D]tand
       
BRIDGE:
[C]Ho - [G]ly, [Em]Ho - [D]ly, [C]Ho - [G]ly O[D]ne    [Bm]
[C]Ho - [G]ly, [Em]Ho - [D]ly, [C]Ho - [G]ly O[D]ne, You [Bm]are
[C]Ho - [G]ly, [Em]Ho - [D]ly, [C]Ho - [G]ly O[D]ne, You [Bm]are
[C]Ho - [G]ly, [Em]Ho - [D]ly, [C]Ho - [G]ly O[D]ne</text>
