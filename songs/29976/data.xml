Verse 1: 
[E]How I love my Ch[A]urch
[F#m]I have shed my [E/G#]very blood to s[B]ave her
[E]I do love my Ch[A]urch
[F#m]I will never [E/G#]leave her nor fors[B]ake her
I will be [C#m]with you in the darkest night your s[A]oul will ever face
I will sust[C#m]ain you through your death and bring you 
s[A]afely to my h[B]eavenly pl[E]ace


Verse 2: 
[E]I will win my Ch[A]urch
[F#m]I am calling [E/G#]her from every [A]tongue and tr[B]ibe
[E]I will win my Ch[A]urch
[F#m]For I’ve chosen [E/G#]her to be my s[A]potless br[B]ide
My [C#m]robe of righteousness will cover [A]all of your disgrace
And [C#m]every sin will disappear and s[A]ink into my s[B]ea of gr[E]ace

Verse 3: 
[E]I will build my Ch[A]urch
[F#m]And the gates of [E/G#]hell won’t stand bef[A]ore h[B]er
[E]I will build my Ch[A]urch
For [F#m]who can def[E/G#]eat her if [A]I am f[B]or her
[C#m]Do not be afraid for every tr[A]ial you endure
[C#m]I will work for good and make it s[A]erve only to m[B]ake you p[E]ure


Verse 4: 
[E]And since I love you, my Ch[A]urch,
[F#m]I command you [E/G#]also, l[A]ove each [B]other
[E]And as I forgave you, Ch[A]urch,
[F#m]I want you to [E/G#]also forg[A]ive each o[B]ther
As [C#m]I have freely given you, so y[A]ou must freely give
And [C#m]if you love like I’ve loved you, m[A]any blind will s[B]ee I L[E]IVE!
