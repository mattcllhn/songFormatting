		<text>Verse 1:
It [C]came u[F]pon a [C]midnight clear,
That [F]glorious [D7]song of [G7]old,
From [C]angels [F]bending [C]near the earth,
To [F]touch their [G7]harps of [C]gold;
“Peace [E7]on the earth, good [Am]will to men,
From [G]Heaven’s all-[D7]gracious [G]King.” [G/F]
The [C/E]world in [F]solemn [C/G]stillness [C]lay,
To [F]hear the [G7]angels [C]sing.


Verse 2:
Still [C]through the [F]cloven [C]skies they come
With [F]peaceful [D7]wings un[G7]furled,
And [C]still their [F]heavenly [C]music floats
O’er [F]all the [G7]weary [C]world;
A[E7]bove its sad and [Am]lowly plains,
They [G]bend on [D7]hovering [G]wing, [G/F]
And [C/E]ever [F]o’er its [C/G]Babel [C]sounds
The [F]blessèd [G7]angels [C]sing.

Verse 3:
And [C]ye, be[F]neath life’s [C]crushing load,
Whose [F]forms are [D7]bending [G7]low,
Who [C]toil a[F]long the [C]climbing way
With [F]painful [G7]steps and [C]slow,
Look [E7]now! for glad and [Am]golden hours
Come [G]swiftly [D7]on the [G]wing. [G/F]
O [C/E]rest be[F]side the [C/G]weary [C]road,
And [F]hear the [G7]angels [C]sing!


Verse 4:
For [C]lo! the [F]days are [C]hastening on,
By [F]prophet-[D7]bards fore[G7]told,
When [C]with the [F]ever-[C]circling years
Comes [F]round the [G7]age of [C]gold;
When [E7]peace shall over [Am]all the earth
Its [G]ancient [D7]splendors [G]fling, [G/F]
And [C/E]the whole [F]world send [C/G]back the [C]song
Which [F]now the [G7]angels [C]sing.</text>
