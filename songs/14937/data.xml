[| E2     | A2     | E2     | A2     |]

Verse 1: 
[E] [ ]Though waves of troubles [Amaj7]come, and pour in like a [C#m]flood
My [B]soul will no[A2]t despair
[E] [ ]Within Your sovereign [Amaj7]arms, no valley is too [C#m]dark
To [B]keep me fro[A2]m your care
Your [B/D#]presence and Your p[A/C#]romises, are [B/D#]joy and life to [A]me

Chorus: 
Jesus, [E]You’re my [F#9]glorious [Amaj7    B]hope, [ ]ever [E]faithful [F#9]to Your [Amaj7    B]own
You have [E/G#]filled my [A]nights, with Your [F#m7]sweet song of gr[B]ace
Jesus [C#m]You’re my [B]glorious [A2]hope
My glorious [E     | Amaj9     | C#m   B   | A     |]hope

Verse 2: 
[E] [ ]When condemnations [Amaj7]rise, when failures fill my [C#m]eyes
Re[B]mind me onc[A2]e again
[E] [ ]That my sufficien[Amaj7]cy,{,} is found upon the [C#m]tree
That [B]bought my right[A]eousness
The [B/D#]depth of Your unchang[A/C#]ing love, dis[B/D#]played on Calva[A (to chorus)]ry

Bridge: 
And [F#m7]Je[E/G#]sus, ev’ry [A]trial only [Bsus4]proves
You're [F#m7]wor[E/G#]thy of all the [A]trust I place in [Bsus4]You
My glorious [| C#m     B  A  | A     |]hope
[C#m] [ ]You’re my [B]glorious [A]hope
[C#m] [ ]You’re my [B]glorious [A]hope</text>
