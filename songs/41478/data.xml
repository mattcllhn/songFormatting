It is a sword, this word of God,
A weapon strong and good.
It has been forged by sovereign grace,
Prophetic fire and blood.
It's double-edged and there exists
No other blade so fine,
But skillful use is only learned
Through active use and time.

It is a sword with which to fight,
A sabre for the war,
For frequent are the battles and
Its use will bring its scar.
Designed as an offensive tool,
Not merely to defend,
Attack the enemy with it
And put him to an end!

And yet be warned!  This sword you wield
Becomes the Surgeon's knife
And ruthlessly reveals your sin;
It wounds to save your life.
It lives and acts and pierces deep,
A paradox indeed
The very sword that slays your foe
In mercy makes us bleed.

Grip tight the sword and keep it poised
When come the times of test.
Remain alert, its hilt in reach,
In times of peace and rest.
It is your hope, your confidence
When facing pain or strife;
Your guide, your strength, your faithful friend --
Indeed, it is your life! (Deut.32:47)
