[A     | F#m7     | A/C#     | D     ]

VERSE 1: 
Now [A]why this fear and [A/G#]unbel[F#m]ief?
Has [A/C#]not the Father put to [D]grief
His [E]spotless Son for [A]us
And [A]will the righteous [A/G#]Judge of [F#m]men
Con[A/C#]demn me for the debt of [D]sin
Now [E]cancelled at the [A]cross?

CHORUS: 
[D]Je[A/C#]-[D]sus, [D]all [A/C#]my [D]trust is [E]in Your [A]blood
[D]Je[A/C#]-[D]sus, You’ve [D]re[A/C#]scued [D]us, 
Through [E]Your great [A] [ ]love [| F#m7     | A/C#     | D     |] 

VERSE 2: 
Com[A]plete atonement [A/G#]You have [F#m]made
And [A/C#]by Your death have fully [D]paid
The [E]debt Your people [A]owed
No [A]wrath remains for [A/G#]us to [F#m]face
We’re [A/C#]sheltered by Your saving [D]grace
And [E]sprinkled with Your [A]blood

CHORUS: 
[D]Je[A/C#]-[D]sus, [D]all [A/C#]my [D]trust is [E]in Your [A]blood
[D]Je[A/C#]-[D]sus, You’ve [D]re[A/C#]scued [D]us, through [E]Your great[A] love [| A] 

BRIDGE: 
How [D]sweet the sound of [A/C#]saving [D]grace
How [D]sweet the sound of [A/C#]saving [D]grace
Christ [E]died for [A (repeat, then to intro)]me

VERSE 3: 
Be [A]still my soul and [A/G#]know this [F#m]peace
The [A/C#]merits of your great high [D]priest, have [E]bought your liber[A]ty
Re[A]ly then on His [A/G#]precious [F#m]blood
Don’t [A/C#]fear your banishment from [D]God, since [E]Jesus sets you [A]free</text>
