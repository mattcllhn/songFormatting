		<text>Verse 1: 
O [D]little [Ddim]town of [Em]Bethlehem, how [D]still we [A7]see thee [D]lie
A[D]bove thy [Em]deep and [G]dreamless sleep, the [D]silent [A7]stars go [D]by
Yet [D]in thy [Em]dark streets [F#7]shineth, the [Bm]everlasting [F#7]Light
The [D]hopes and [Ddim]fears of [Em]all the [G]years
Are [D]met in [A7sus]thee [D]tonight

Verse 2: 
For [D]Christ is [Ddim]born of [Em]Mary, and [D]gathered [A7]all a[D]bove
While [D]mortals [Em]sleep, the [G]angels keep, their [D]watch of [A7]wondering [D]love
O [D]morning [Em]stars [F#7]together, pro[Bm]claim the holy [F#7]birth
And [D]praises [Ddim]sing to [Em]God the [G]King
And [D]Peace to [A7sus]men on [D]earth

Verse 3: 
How [D]silent[Ddim]ly, how [Em]silently, the [D]wondrous [A7]gift is [D]given!
So [D]God im[Em]parts to [G]human hearts, the [D]blessings [A7]of His [D]heaven.
No [D]ear may [Em]hear His [F#7]coming, but [Bm]in this world of [F#7]sin,
Where [D]meek souls [Ddim]will re[Em]ceive Him [G]still,
The [D]dear Christ [A7sus]enters [D]in.

Verse 4: 
O [D]holy [Ddim]Child of [Em]Bethlehem, de[D]scend to [A7]us, we [D]pray
Cast [D]out our [Em]sin and [G]enter in, be [D]born to [A7]us to[D]day
We [D]hear the [Em]Christmas [F#7]angels, the [Bm]great glad tidings [F#7]tell
O [D]come to [Ddim]us, a[Em]bide with [G]us
Our [D]Lord E[A7sus]mmanu[D]el</text>
