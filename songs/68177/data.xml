[C    | G    | Am7    | Em  D  | C    | G    | Am7   | Em  D  | C   | C ]

VERSE 1:
[G] You spoke and time began
[C/G] Light dawned at Your command
And [G]by Your Word the [D/G]Earth began to [C/G]    move [| C/G]
[G] Carved mountains with Your hands, [C/G]  breathed life into all men
You [G]made it all and [D/G]saw that it was[C/G] good

PRE-CH 1:
[Am] There is no [Em]rival [D]  to You, O God
[Am] All kings and [Em]idols will [D]one day fall

CHORUS:
[C]Who among the [G]gods is like Y[Em]ou? [| D]
[C]Who could ever [G]measure{,} all You've [Em]done, O G[D]od?
Cre[C]ator, Sust[G]ainer, [Em]merciful [D]Savior, for[C]ever on You[D]r throne
You stand a[C]lone,[| G   | Am7   | Em7] [ ]Yo[D]u sta[| C]nd alo[| G   | Am7   | Em D]ne

VERSE 2:
[G] Your Spirit gave the Law, [C/G]    in kindness to us all
And [Em]though we never k[D]ept it,{,} You were [C]true
[G] Lawmaker, You have saved{,} [C/G]   lawbreakers from the grave
And [Em]by Your Son{,} our [D]guilt has been re[C]moved

PRE-CH 2:
[Am]  Your endless [Em]glory [D]  shines through Your Son
[Am]  There is no [Em]story of [D]greater love

BRIDGE:
[||:]    [C] There is no one [G]like our G[Am]od{,} (Yo[|]u [Em]stand [D]alone[:||]) [(4x) ]
