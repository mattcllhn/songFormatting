		<text>Verse 1:
Rock of [A]Ages, [D]cleft for [A]me, let me [A]hide my[E]self in [A]Thee
[E]Let the [E]water [E7]and the [A]blood, [E]from Thy [Bm]wounded [E7]side which [F#m]flowed
Be of [A]sin the [D]double [A]cure, save from [F#m]wrath and [E]make me [A]pure


Verse 2:
Not the [A]labors [D]of my [A]hands, can ful[A]fill Thy [E]lawâ€™s de[A]mands
[E]Could my [E]zeal no [E7]respite [A]know, [E]could my [Bm]tears for[E7]ever [F#m]flow
All for [A]sin could [D]not a[A]tone, Thou must [F#m]save, and [E]Thou a[A]lone


Verse 3:
Nothing [A]in my [D]hand I [A]bring, simply [A]to the [E]cross I [A]cling
[E]Naked [E]come to [E7]Thee for [A]dress, [E]helpless [Bm]look to [E7]Thee for [F#m]grace
Foul I [A]to the [D]fountain [A]fly, wash me [F#m]Savior, [E]or I [A]die        


Verse 4:
While I [A]draw this [D]fleeting [A]breath, when my [A]eyes shall [E]close in [A]death
[E]When I [E]soar to [E7]worlds un[A]known, [E]see Thee [Bm]on Thy [E7]judgment [F#m]throne, 
Rock of [A]Ages, [D]cleft for [A]me, let me [F#m]hide my[E]self in [A]Thee</text>
