		<text>Verse 1:
[A]He is Jealous for me  
L[F#m]oves like a hurricane, I am a tree 
B[Esus]ending beneath the weight of His wind and m[D2]ercy
When [A]all of a sudden 
I am unaware of these affl[F#m]ictions eclipsed by glory
I re[Esus]alize just how beautiful You are
And how g[D2]reat Your affections are for me

Chorus 1:
[A]Oh how he loves us, [F#m]oh!  Oh how he [Esus]loves us
How He loves us, [D2] oh!  [A    F#m    Esus    Dmaj7]

Verse 2:
[A]We are His portion and He is our prize
[F#m] Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes
If [Esus] grace     is an ocean we're [D2]all sinking
So H[A]eaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss
And my [F#m]heart    turns violently inside of my chest
I [Esus]don't have time to maintain these regrets
When I t[D2]hink about    the way that

Chorus 2:
He l[A]oves us, oh how he [F#m]loves us
Oh how He lo[E]ves us, oh how He lo[D2]ves
Yeah He l[A]oves us, oh how He [F#m]loves us
Oh how He lo[E]ves us, oh how He lo[D2]ves</text>
