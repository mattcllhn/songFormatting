To Your [Em7]glorious rest a[A/C#]bove  [Bm | A]

Oh the [Dsus]deep, [D]deep love of J[D2]e[D]sus
Spread His [F#m7]praise from shore to [G2]shore
How He [Dsus]came [D]to pay our [D2]ran[D]som
Through the [Em7]saving cross He [D]bore
How He [A/C#]watches o’er His [Bm]loved ones
Those He [G2]died to make His [D]own
How for [A/C#]them He’s [Em]inter[G2]ceding
Pleading [Em7]now before the [A/C#]throne   [Bm | A]
