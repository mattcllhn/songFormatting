From slavery and s[G2(no3)]hame / I [Asus]am rede[D]emed

And heaven can’t con[G2(no3)]tain 
The glory [Bm7]of the [Asus]Son
Jesus [D/F#]is the [G2(no3)]Christ the Sav[Bm7]ing [Asus]One
His love has [D/F#]made a [G2(no3)]way
The grave is [Bm7]overc[Asus]ome
Jesus [D/F#]is the [G2(no3)]Christ the [Asus]Saving O[D]ne

Bridge: 
And [G2(no3)]anyone who calls up[Bm7]on his [Asus]name
They will [D/F#]be    [G2(no3)]saved, they will [Bm7]be s[Asus]aved   [D/F#] 
[G2(no3)]Anyone who calls up[Bm7]on his [Asus]name

And removed all my [Bm] shame
[D/F#]You are amazing, [G] God
[D] Indestructible, [A] undefeatable
[G]You destroyed death’s claim on me
When you conquered the [Bm] grave
