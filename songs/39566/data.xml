Oh, what a [C2]day, [G]  what a[Bm7] glorious day
Oh, what a [C2]day, [G]  what a [Bm7]glorious day

What a [D]day, [G]  what a [Bm7]day [G]

See the [D]empty [Em]tomb, [G2]   see the [D]grave clothes [Em]there [G2]
He has [D]left this [Em]place, [G2]   You won't [D/F#]find Him [Asus]here
All our [D]fears have [Em]fled, [G2]   let our [D]hopes ar[Em]ise [G2]
Heaven [D]waits for [Em]us, [G2]   we will [D/F#]never [Asus]die
