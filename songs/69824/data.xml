		<text>
	Come and hear, all you who fear God,
		   and I will tell what he has done for my soul.
	I cried to him with my mouth,
		   and high praise was on my tongue.
	If I had cherished iniquity in my heart,
		   the Lord would not have listened.
	But truly God has listened;
		   he has attended to the voice of my prayer.
	Blessed be God,
		   because he has not rejected my prayer
		   or removed his steadfast love from me! </text>
