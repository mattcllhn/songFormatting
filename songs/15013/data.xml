Verse 1:  
Jesus, I’[G2]m frail, I’m so very[Am] weak

But You are my[G2] rock,{,} my shelter and[Am] shade
When I’m burdened[D] down, You’ll carry the[C2] weight

Chorus:
So I will [G2]cast my [D/F#]cares on [C]You 
Yes, I will [Em7]cast my [D/F#]cares on [C]You  [| D]
I will [Em]rest within Your [D/F#]arms 	 	 
Knowing [G]I am safe from [Am7]harm 
[Bm7]I will cast my [C]cares on [G2 (to intro)]You

Verse 2:
When I’m over[G2]whelmed{,} and I cannot[Am] stand 	 
You hear every[D] cry and You lift my[C2] head   	 
I’m desperate for[G2] grace and mercy a[Am]new  	 
I must have Your[D] strength,{,} oh I must have[C2] You</text>
