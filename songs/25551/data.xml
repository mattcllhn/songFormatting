		<text>INTRO:
[B  |   F#7sus  |  G#m  |  E]

VERSE 1:
To the cross I [B]look, to the cross I [F#7sus]cling
Of it's suffering I do[G#m] drink, of it's work I do[E] sing
For on it my s[B]avior, both bruised and cr[F#7sus]ushed
Showed that God is [G#m]love and God is [E]just

CHORUS:
[B]At the cross You beckon me
[G#m]You draw me gently to my knees, and I am
[F#7sus]Lost for words, so lost in love, I'm
[E]Sweetly broken, wholly surrendered[B   |   G#m   |   F#m7sus   |   E] 

VERSE 2:
What a priceless [B]gift, undeserved l[F#7sus]ife
Have I been g[G#m]iven through Christ crucif[E]ied
You've called me out of d[B]eath, 
You've called me into [F#7sus]life
I was under your wr[G#m]ath, 
Now through the cross I'm reconc[E]iled

BRIDGE:
[C#m]In awe of the cross I must conf[E]ess
[C#m]How wondrous Your redeeming love
And how [E]great is Your faithful[F#7sus]ness [B]
