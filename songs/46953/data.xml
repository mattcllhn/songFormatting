[G     | G     | C     | C]

VERSE 1:
Oh[G] God of power, living Word, the [C]One who made the stars
Who [G]with Your glory filled the earth, from [C]dust made beating hearts
You [C]loved us [Am]when we [Em]fell away, poured [C]mercy on our so[D]uls
And [C]promised [Am]grace would [Em]come to save, to [C]loose death’s iron [D]hold

CHORUS:
[G]You are our song from age to age
Our [D]voices unite to recount Your praise, a[C]gain and a[Em]gain [D]
[G]You are our song from age to age
[D]We will proclaim Your pow’r to save, a[C]gain and a[Em  D  | G  | G  | C  | C]gain

VERSE 2:
Oh [G]God of promises fulfilled, the [C]God who took on flesh
Who [G]did all that the Father willed, was [C]humbled unto death
You [C]bore our [Am]cross of [Em]sin and shame, en[C]dured our agon[D]y
With [C]gladness [Am]we now [Em]bear Your name{,} and [C]worship at Your [D]feet

VERSE 3:
Oh [G]God, who surely guides our steps
Through [C]tempests and through trials
Our [G]Shepherd King, Your way is best, though [C]tears now veil our eyes
Your [C]steadfast [Am]love, our [Em]perfect hope, our [C]eyes are fixed on [D]grace
We [C]have no [Am]doubt You’ll [Em]lead us home{,} to [C]finally see Your [D]face

VERSE 4:
Oh [G]God of all of history, enth[C]roned in realms of light
What [G]eyes of faith have strained to see{,} will [C]one day fill our sight
With [C]all the [Am]saints we’ll [Em]lay our crowns{,} be[C]fore the Savior’s [D]feet
And [C]sing as [Am]all the [Em]heav’ns resound{,} for [C]all eterni[D]ty</text>
