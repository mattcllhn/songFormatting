		<text>Chorus:
[E]  I come boldly, [B]  trusting only [F#m7]  Your redeeming l[A2    |]ove,
[E]  Flowing freely, [B]  from Your side now, [F#m7]  Your atoning bl[A2    |]ood
[E]  Like a river, [B/D#]  like a fountain, [A/C#]  like a cleansing fl[A2]ood
I [C#m7]pour out my [A2]worship to Y[Bsus4    |]ou
For [B]Your redeeming l[E    | B/E    | A    | A]ove

Verse 1:
My gl[C#m]ory,{,} in Your [D2]cross of shame and [E]suff[Esus4   | E   Esus4]'ring
My gl[C#m]ory,{,} what the [D2]world disdains as [E]noth[Esus4   | Bsus4   B]ing
I will gl[F#m7]ory in such [Esus4/B]foolish[E/B]ness
I will gl[F#m7]ory, for it's [Esus4/B]nothing [E/B]less,
Than Your [F#m7]wisdom{,} and your [E/G#]awesome pow'r, my [A2    | B    |]God

Verse 2:
My gl[C#m]ory,{,} in Your [D2]deep humili[E]a[Esus4   | E   Esus4]tion
You f[C#m]ound me,{,} and You [D2]crowned me with sal[E]va[Esus4   | Bsus4   B]tion
I will [F#m7]glory, all my [Esus4/B]sin and [E/B]guilt
Have been [F#m7]covered by the [Esus4/B]blood You [E/B]spilt
And now I'm [F#m7]living{,} in Your [E/G#]resurrection [A2    | B    |]light</text>
