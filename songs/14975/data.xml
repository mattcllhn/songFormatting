Be[C#m]neath the cross of J[E]esus
Lord, [F#m]I would spend my da[A]ys
In the [C#m]shadow of the [E]One{,} who ransomed m[F#m]e
May I [C#m]not become fa[E]miliar
With its [F#m]marvelous good [A]news

With it [E]always in my [F#m]view, oh [A]
	
Chorus:
At the foot of the [E]cross  [B]
Lord I [F#m]bow down and wor[A]ship
Over[C#m]come by [B]so great a love [A]
At the foot of the [E]cross  [B]
I will [F#m]cherish all Your [A]mercy
All Your [C#m]goodness, Your wi[B]sdom, Your pow’[F#]r
At the [A]foot of the [||: C#m    E    | F#m    A2    :||]cross.  

Verse 2:
Up[C#m]on the cross of J[E]esus
Lord, [F#m]I would fix my [A]eyes
For it [C#m]always will remi[E]nd me{,} of these [F#m]truths
My in[C#m]iquity seems e[E]ndless,
Yet [F#m]greater still your [A]grace
And I will [C#m]glory in the [E]cross
Throughout the a[F#m]ges, oh [A]</text>
