[C/E     | F     | C/G     | G]

VERSE 1:
Father, [C]I can come to [Gsus]You{,} and boast of [C]deeds I've [F]done
In my [C]pride I strive to [Gsus]earn{,} the favor [C]Christ has [F]won
He a[G]lone pleads my ac[F]ceptance, [C/E]all my [F]works [C/E]a[F]side
So I [C]come with empty [G]hands{,} and I [F]cling to [C/E]Christ. [| F    | C/G    | G]

VERSE 2:
Father, [C]I can go a[Gsus]stray{,} and battle [C/E]needless [F]fears
Voices [C]tell me I’m con[Gsus]demned{,} and that I [C/E]can’t draw [F]near
But Your [G]Spirit calls me [F]homeward{,} [C/E]with Your [F]words [C/E]of [F]life
Jesus [C]bore my every [G]sin,{,} so I [F]cling to [C]Christ [| C]

BRIDGE:
It’s more than [Dm7]I can [Am]do{,} to keep my [F]hold on [G]You
But all my [Dm7]hope and [Am]peace{,} is that You [F]cling to [G]me
It’s more than [Dm7]I can [Am]do{,} to keep my [F]hold on [G]You
But all my [Dm7]hope and [Am]peace{,} is that You [F]cling to [G]me [| G]

VERSE 3:
Father, [C]all my earthly [Gsus]aims{,} in time will [C/E]turn to [F]dust
Let me [C]learn that loss is [Gsus]gain{,} for those who [C/E]know Your [F]love
All the [G]treasures of this [F]world{,} will [C/E]never [F]sa[C/E]tis[F]fy
You al[C]one are endless j[G]oy, so I c[F]ling to [Am7]Chri[(to go to bridge)]st [C]

TO END:
You a[C]lone are endless [Gsus]joy, so I [F]cling to [C]Christ.</text>
