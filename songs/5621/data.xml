Nor [C9]wanting, nor [D]wasting, [Em]Thou [G/D]rulest [D]in [G]might;
Thy [G]justice, like [G/F#]mountains, high [Em]soaring a[D]bove

In [C9]all life Thou [D]livest, [Em]the [G/D]true life [D]of [G]all;
We [G]blossom and [G/F#]flourish, as [Em]leaves on the [D]tree,
And [C9]wither and [D]perish, [Em]but [G/D]naught chang[D]eth [G]Thee.

All [G]laud we would [G/F#]render, O [Em]help us to [D]see
