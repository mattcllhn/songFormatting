		<text>Verse 1:
Should [E]nothing of our [Emaj9(no3rd)]efforts stand, no [C#m]legacy surv[A]ive
Un[E]less the Lord does [Emaj9(no3rd)]raise the house, in [A]vain its builders st[E]rive
To [E]you who boast [Emaj9(no3rd)]tomorrow’s gain, tell [C#m]me what is your l[A]ife
A [E]mist that vanis[Emaj9(no3rd)]hes at dawn, all g[A]lory be to Ch[E]rist!


Chorus:
All g[E]lory be to [Emaj9(no 3rd)]Christ our king! All [C#m]glory be to Ch[A]rist!
His r[E]ule and reign we’ll [Emaj9(no3rd)]ever sing, all g[A]lory be to Ch[E]rist!


Verse 2:
His [E]will be done, His [F#m]kingdom come, on e[A]arth as is a[B]bove
Who [E]is Himself our [F#m]daily bread, praise [A]Him the Lord of l[E]ove
Let [E]living water s[F#m]atisfy the th[A]irsty without pri[B]ce
We’ll t[E]ake a cup of [F#m]kindness yet, all [A]glory [B]be to Ch[E]rist!


{key:Eb}
Verse 3:
[E]Whe[-]n [Emaj]on the day the [EMaj]great I Am, the [C#m]faithful and the [A]true  
The [E]Lamb who was for [EMaj]sinners slain, is [A]making all things [E]new.
Be[E]hold our God shall [EMaj]live with us and [C#m]be our steadfast [A]light
And [E]we shall ere his pe[EMaj]ople be, all [A]glory be to C[E]hrist!
