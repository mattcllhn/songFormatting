VERSE 1: 
[Bb]O holy [Bbmaj7]night, the [Eb/Bb]stars are brightly [Bb]shining,
It is the [Bb]night of the [F/Bb]dear Savior’s [Eb/Bb]birth.
[Bb]Long lay the [Bbmaj7]world in [Eb/Bb]sin and error [Bb]pining,
Till He ap[Dm]peared and the [Am]soul felt its [Dm]worth.
A [F]thrill of [F/Eb]hope, the [Bb/D]weary world rejoices,
For [Cm7]yonder breaks a [Bb]new and glorious [F/A]morn.
[Ebmaj7]Fall on your [Dm7/F]knees, O [Cm]hear the angel [Gm7]voi[C7]ces!
O [Bb/F  F]night di[Gm  Gm/F  C7/E]vine, [ ]O [Bb/F]night[F] when Christ was [Bb]born! [(intro)] 

VERSE 2: 
[Bb]Humbly He [Bbmaj7]lay, Crea[Eb/Bb]tor come as cre[Bb]ature,
Born on the f[Bb]loor of a [F/Bb]hay-scattered [Eb/Bb]stall.
[Bb]True Son of [Bbmaj7]God,{,} yet [Eb/Bb]bearing human [Bb]feature,
He entered [Dm]earth to re[Am]verse Adam’s [Dm]fall.
In [F]towering g[F/Eb]race, He [Bb/D]laid aside His glory,
And [Cm7]in our place, was [Bb]sacrificed for [F/A]sin.
[Ebmaj7]Fall on your kne[Dm7/F]es! O [Cm]hear the gospel [Gm7]sto[C7]ry!
O [Bb/F  F]night di[Gm  Gm/F  C7/E]vine, [ ]O [Bb/F]night[F7] when Christ was [Bb]born! [F/A]

VERSE 3: 
[Bb]Come, then, to H[Bbmaj7]im{,} Who [Eb/Bb]lies within the ma[Bb]nger,
With joyful sh[Bb]epherds, pro[F/Bb]claim Him as L[Eb/Bb]ord.
[Bb]Let not the Pr[Bbmaj7]omised [Eb/Bb]Son remain a [Bb]stranger;
In reverent w[Dm]orship, make [Am]Christ your A[Dm]dored.
E[F]ternal l[F/Eb]ife is [Bb/D]theirs who would receive Him;
With [Cm7]grace and peace, their [Bb]lives He will [F/A]adorn.
[Ebmaj7]Fall on your kn[Dm7/F]ees! Re[Cm]ceive the Gift of [Bb]hea[Gm]v[C7]en!
