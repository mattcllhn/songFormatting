		<text>Zephaniah 3:14-17

Sing aloud, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel!
Rejoice and exult with all your heart, O daughter of Jerusalem!
The LORD has taken away the judgments against you;
he has cleared away your enemies.
The King of Israel, the LORD, is in your midst; 
You shall never again fear evil.

On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem:
â€œFear not, O Zion; let not your hands grow weak.
The LORD your God is in your midst, a mighty one who will save;
he will rejoice over you with gladness; he will quiet you by his love;
he will exult over you with loud singing.


Psalm 32:7

You are a hiding place for me; you preserve me from trouble;
you surround me with shouts of deliverance. Selah


Psalm 22:9-10

Yet you are he who took me from the womb;
you made me trust you at my mother's breasts.
On you was I cast from my birth,
and from my mother's womb you have been my God.

Hebrews 2:14-15

Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, 
he himself likewise partook of the same things, 
that through death he might destroy the one 
who has the power of death, that is, the devil, 
and deliver all those who through fear of death 
were subject to lifelong slavery.


1 Peter 1:3-5

Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! 
According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be 
born again to a living hope through 
the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 
to an inheritance that is imperishable, 
undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you,
who by God's power are being guarded through faith 
for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
