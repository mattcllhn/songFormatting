		<text>VERSE 1: 
[A]   Blessed [E]be Your name
In the [F#m7]land that is [D]plentiful
Where Your st[A]reams of ab[E]undance flow
B[D]lessed be Your name

VERSE 2: 
[A]   Blessed [E]be Your name
When I’m [F#m7]found in the [D]desert place
Though I [A]walk through the [E]wilderness
B[D]lessed be Your name

CHORUS: 
[A]   Ev’ry blessing [E]You pour out I’ll [F#m7]    turn back to p[D]raise
[A]   When the darkness [E]closes in, Lord
[F#m7]   Still I will [D]say, “Blessed be the [A]name of the [E]Lord
Blessed be Your[F#m7] name    [D] 
Blessed be the [A]name of the [E]Lord
Blessed be Your [F#m7]glor[E]ious n[D]ame

VERSE 3: 
[A]   Blessed [E]be Your name

When the [A]world’s “all as [E]it should be”
[D]Blessed be Your name

VERSE 4: 
[A]   Blessed [E]be Your name
On the [F#m7]road marked with [D]suffering

[D]Blessed be Your name

CHORUS: 
[A]   Ev’ry blessing [E]You pour out I’ll [F#m7]    turn back to p[D]raise
[A]   When the darkness [E]closes in, Lord

Blessed be Your[F#m7] name    [D] 
Blessed be the [A]name of the [E]Lord
Blessed be Your [F#m7]glor[E]ious n[D]ame
