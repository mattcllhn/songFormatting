[E] [ ]You hid Your glory from our eyes
[E] [ ]A man or sorrows, man of [B]suffering [Bsus4]
[B] [ ]Became a servant born to [F#m]die
[F#m] [ ]The Lamb of God, a [E/G#]perfect [A2]offering
[A2] [ ]And at the hands of wicked [E]men
[E]Your back plowed open by a [B]cruel lash [Bsus4]
[B] [ ]We crowned Your bleeding head{,} with [F#m]thorns
[F#m] [ ]You drank God’s foaming [E/G#]cup{,} of [A]holy wrath [B]

Chorus:
[E] [ ]To You be[E/D#]longs my h[C#m7]eart,{,} to You be[E/B]longs my p[A]raise

[E] [ ]To You be[E/D#]longs my [C#m7]heart,{,} to You be[E/B]longs my p[A]raise
To You be[A/G#]longs [E/G#]my [F#m]love,{,} I’ll thank You [A/B]all [E/B]my [E       | E       B |]days

Verse 2:
[E] [ ]For a good man someone might die
[E] [ ]Or give himself to save the [B]righteous [Bsus4]
[B] [ ]But You have shown Your love in [F#m]this
[F#m] [ ]When we were still in [E/G#]sin You [A2]died for us
[A2] [ ]Such wondrous love demands my [E]all
[E] [ ]Such lavish grace is worthy [B]of my life [Bsus4]
[B] [ ]I’ll always owe this debt of [F#m]love
[F#m] [ ]I give my heart to [E/G#]You, Lord [A]Jesus Christ [B]</text>
