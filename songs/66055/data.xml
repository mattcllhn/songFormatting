Verse 1: 
Should auld acquaintance be forgot, 
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot, 
And auld lang syne. (And long, long ago)

Chorus: 
For auld lang syne, my jo, (my dear)
For auld lang syne, 
We'll tak a cup o' kindness yet, 
For auld lang syne, 

Verse 2: 
And surely ye'll be your pint-stowp! (you’ll buy your pint-jug!)
And surely I'll be mine! (I'll buy mine!)
And we'll tak a cup o' kindness yet, 
For auld lang syne. 

Verse 3: 
We twa hae run abūt the braes (We two have run about the hills)
And pū'd the gowans fine; (And pulled the daisies fine)
But we've wander'd mōny a weary fit (many a weary foot)
Sin auld lang syne. 

Verse 4: 
We twa hae paidl'd i' the burn, (We two have paddled in the stream)
Frae mornin' sun till dine; *(From morn till dinner-time)
But seas between us braid hae roar'd (broad have roared)
Sin auld lang syne. 

Verse 5: 
And there's a hand, my trusty fiere! (my trusty friend!)
And gie's a hand o' thine! (And give us a hand of yours!)
And we'll tak a right guid willy waught, (a deep draught of good-will)
For auld lang syne.
