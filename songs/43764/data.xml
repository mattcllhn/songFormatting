		<text>Psalm 96:4-6

Declare his glory among the nations,
      his marvelous works among all the peoples!
For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised;
      he is to be feared above all gods.
For all the gods of the peoples are worthless idols,
      but the LORD made the heavens.
Splendor and majesty are before him;
      strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.</text>
