[D/F#]Round my heart still [G]closely [A]twined, the [D/F#]ties that none can [Bm]se[A]ver
For [D]I am His and [Asus]He is [Bm] mine, for[Em7]ever and for[A]ev[D (to intro)]er


Verse 2:
[D]Jesus, friend of [G]sin[D]ners, a [D]crown of thorns You [A]wore for [G]me
[D]Bruised for my trans[G]gres[D]sions, [Em7]pierced for my in[A]iqui[D]ties
The [D/F#]wrath of God that [G]I de[A]served, was [D/F#]poured out on the [Bm]inno[A]cent
He [D]took my place, my [A]soul to [Bm] save, now [Em7]I am his for[A]ev[D     | D     |]er
