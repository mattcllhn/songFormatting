		<text>INTRO:
[E     | E    | F#m     | F#m     (2X)]

VERSE 1:
[E]We are not what we should be
We [F#m7]haven’t sought what we should seek
We’ve [A]seen Your glory [F#m]Lord, but looked away[E     | E]
Our [E]hearts are bent our eyes are dim
Our [F#m7]finest works are stained with sin
And [A]emptiness has [F#m]shadowed all our ways [E     | E]

CHORUS:
[A]Jesus Chr[E]ist, shine in[Amaj7/C#]to our ni[A]ght
Drive our [E]dark away [Amaj7]
‘Til Your [C#m]glory fills our [A]eyes
[A]Jesus Chr[E]ist, shine in[Amaj7/C#]to our ni[A]ght
Bind us t[E]o Your cross, [Amaj7][ ]where we find l[E]ife

VERSE 2:
[E]Still we often go astray
We [F#m7]chase the world, forget Your grace
But [A]You have never [F#m]failed to bring us back [E      | E]
Re[E]veal the depths of what You’ve done
The [F#m7]death You died, the vic’try won
You [A]made a way for [F#m]us to know Your love [E      | E]
