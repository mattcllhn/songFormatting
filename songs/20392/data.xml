[D]Cast upon my [E]Savior’s cross are [F#M7]all my sins[E]

Your [D]cleansing blood has [E]covered me
And [F#M7]washed me clean, it will [E]never fail
	
Chorus:
[A2]Day after [D2]day, [A]you never [E]change
With [A]power to [D2]save, and [A]strength to su[E]stain
And we [A]p  r  [D2]a  i  [A]s  e[E] 
We [A]p  r  [D2]a  i  [A]s  e[E]…     Your [D]name[E]   [F#M7]   [E]

Verse 2:
[D]Justified by [E]what you’ve done at [F#M7]Calvary[E]

For [D]when You died and [E]rose again         
You [F#M7]conquered death and de[E]feated sin
