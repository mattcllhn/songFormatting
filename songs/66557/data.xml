[C | Gm Fm | C | Gm Fm]

Verse 1: 
Fac[C]ing a task un[Fmaj]finished
That d[F]rives us [G]to our k[C]nees
A n[C]eed that, undim[F]inished
Re[F]bukes our slothful [Gsus]ease [G] 
We, w[C]ho r[G]ej[C]oice [F]to know [C]Thee
Re[Am]new before Thy t[Dm]hrone
The s[C]olemn pledge we [Fmaj]owe Thee
To [Dm]go and m[G]ake Thee kn[C]own [| Gm Fm | C | Gm Fm]


Verse 2: 

Where [C]other lords b[Fmaj]eside Thee
Hold t[F]heir unh[G]indered s[C]way
Where f[C]orces that def[F]ied Thee
De[F]fy Thee still [Gsus]today [G] 
With [C]none [G]to h[C]eed [F]their cry[C]ing
For [Am]life, and love, and [Dm]light
Unn[C]umbered souls are [Fmaj]dying
And [Dm]pass in[G]to the [C]night


Chorus: 
W[Gsus]e go to [G]all the w[C]orld
With [Gsus]kingdom h[G]ope unf[C]urled
No o[F]ther n[G]ame has p[Em]ower to s[Am]ave
But J[Dm]esus Ch[G]rist The L[C]ord  [| Gm Fm | C | Gm Fm]

Verse 3: 
We b[C]are the torch that fl[Fmaj]aming
Fell f[F]rom the h[G]ands of th[C]ose
Who ga[C]ve their lives procl[F]aiming
That J[F]esus died and [Gsus]rose [G] 
Ours [C]is t[G]he s[C]ame [F]comm[C]ission
The [Am]same glad message [Dm]ours
Fired [C]by the same a[Fmaj]mbition
To [Dm]Thee we y[G]ield our p[C]owers


Chorus: 
W[Gsus]e go to [G]all the w[C]orld
With [Gsus]kingdom h[G]ope unf[C]urled
No o[F]ther n[G]ame has p[Em]ower to s[Am]ave
But J[Dm]esus Ch[G]rist The L[C]ord [| Gm Fm | C | Gm Fm]


Verse 4: 
O Fa[C]ther who s[Fmaj]ustained them
O S[F]pirit w[G]ho insp[C]ired
Savi[C]our, whose love constr[F]ained them
To t[F]oil with zeal un[Gsus]tired [G] 
From [C]cow[G]ard[C]ice de[F]fend [C]us
From [Am]lethargy a[Dm]wake!
Forth [C]on Thine errands [Fmaj]send us
To la[Dm]bour f[G]or Thy s[C]ake</text>
		<searchtext>intro verse 1 facing a task unfinished that drives us to our knees a need that undiminished rebukes our slothful ease we who rejoice to know thee renew before thy throne the solemn pledge we owe thee to go and make thee known verse 2 where other lords beside thee hold their unhindered sway where forces that defied thee defy thee still today with none to heed their crying for life and love and light unnumbered souls are dying and pass into the night chorus we go to all the world with kingdom hope unfurled no other name has power to save but jesus christ the lord verse 3 we bare the torch that flaming fell from the hands of those who gave their lives proclaiming that jesus died and rose ours is the same commission the same glad message ours fired by the same ambition to thee we yield our powers chorus we go to all the world with kingdom hope unfurled no other name has power to save but jesus christ the lord verse 4 o father who sustained them o spirit who inspired saviour whose love constrained them to toil with zeal untired from cowardice defend us from lethargy awake forth on thine errands send us to labour for thy sake</searchtext>
