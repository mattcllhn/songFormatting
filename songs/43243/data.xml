[Dmaj9  |  Gmaj9  |  Dmaj9  |  Gmaj9]

Verse 1: 
Let [Dmaj9]no one caught in sin remain 
In[Gmaj9]side the lie of inward shame
But [Dmaj9/F#]fix our eyes upon the cross
And [Gmaj9]run to Him who s[Bm7]howed great [A(4)]love
And [Dmaj9/F#]bled [Gmaj9]for [A(4)]us
Freely You've [Dmaj9/F#]bled [Gmaj9]for [A(4)]us

Chorus: 
Christ is r[D2]isen from the dead
Trampling over death by death
Come a[Gmaj9]wake come awake
Come and r[Bm7]ise up from the g[A(4)]rave
Christ is r[D2]isen from the dead
We are [D2/F#]one with Him again
Come a[Gmaj9]wake come awake
Come and r[Bm7]ise up from the g[A(4)]rave  [Dmaj9  |  Gmaj9  |  Dmaj9  |  Gmaj9] 

Verse 2: 
Be[Dmaj9]neath the weight of all our sin
You [Gmaj9]bowed to none but heaven's will
No [Dmaj9/F#]scheme of hell no scoffer's crown
No [Gmaj9]burden great can [Bm7]hold You d[A(4)]own
In [Dmaj9/F#]strength [Gmaj9]You r[A(4)]eign
Forever let Your [Dmaj9/F#]church   [Gmaj9]proc-[A(4)]laim
