		<text>Verse 1:
I am [Ab]Thine, O [Eb]Lord, I have [Eb]heard Thy [Ab]voice,
And it [Db]told Thy love to [Ab]me;
But I [Ab]long to [Eb]rise in the [Eb]arms of [Ab]faith
And be [Db]closer [Eb]drawn to [Ab]Thee.

Chorus:
Draw me [Ab]near[Ab]er, [Db]nearer blessed [Ab]Lord,
[Ab/C]To the [Db]cross where [Db]Thou hast [Eb]died;
Draw me [Ab]near[Ab]er, [Db]nearer blessed [Db]Lord,
[Db/Fm]To [Db]Thy [Ab/Eb]precious, [Ab/Eb]blee[Db/Eb]ding [Ab/Db]side [Ab]

Verse 2:
[Ab]Consecrate me [Eb]now to Thy [Eb]service [Ab]Lord,
By the [Db]power of grace di[Ab]vine;
Let my [Ab]soul look [Eb]up with [Eb]steadfast [Ab]hope,
And my [Db]will be [Eb]lost in [Ab]Thine.

Verse 3:
O the [Ab]pure de[Eb]light of a [Eb]single [Ab]hour
That be[Db]fore Thy throne I [Ab]spend;
When I [Ab]kneel in [Eb]prayer, and with [Eb]Thee O [Ab]God,
I com[Db]mune as [Eb]friend with [Ab]friend.

Verse 4:
There are [Ab]depths of [Eb]love that I [Eb]cannot [Ab]know
Till I [Db]cross the narrow [Ab]sea;
There are [Ab]heights of [Eb]joy, that I [Eb]may not [Ab]reach
Till I [Db]rest in [Eb]peace with [Ab]Thee.</text>
