		<text>Intro:
[C#m7     B/D# | E         | C#m7      B/D# | E]

Verse 1:
[C#m7]I no longer fear [B/D#]the grav[E]e,{,} [A2]Christ [E/G#]has  [B/D#]come
[C#m7]Took the sting of death [B/D#]away[E]
Through His [A2]sav[E/G#]ing  [B/D#]blood
[F#m7]Though my body fails{,} and my [C#m7]flesh grows weak
Till my [G#sus]final breath{,} to this [Amaj7]hope I’ll cling

Chorus:
Jesus [E]lives and so shall I [A2]
I’ll be raised from the d[C#m7]ust{,} with Christ on high [A2]
Jesus [E]lives no more to d[A2]ie
And when He ret[C#m7]urns{,} with Him I’ll r[A2]ise
Jesus l[C#m7]ives [B/D# | A2     | C#m7    B/D# | A2]

Verse 2:
[C#m7]In this fallen world [B/D#]I cry, [A] [A2]for [E/G#]the  [B/D#]day
[C#m7]When Your glory splits [B/D#]the s[A]ky
And You [A2]come [E/G#]to   [B/D#]reign
[F#m7]All creation waits for that [C#m7]promised hour
When the [G#sus]saints of God{,} are re[Amaj7]vealed in pow’r[(to chorus)]

Bridge:
[B/D#]Not death nor [C#m7]any power of h[A2]ell
Can separate me from the [B/D#]love,
The [C#m7]love of my [A2]Savior [(repeat)]
[B]  [ ]The love of my S[A2]avior</text>
