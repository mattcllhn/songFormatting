Verse 1:
[Bm]Over [C]land, sky, and [G]sea, over [D]man’s great thoughts and [Bm]dreams
God sits [C]high on His [G]throne, ruling [D]history
[Bm]Nations [C]rage, wars un[G]fold, men seek [D]pow’r they cannot [Bm]hold
God re[C]gards their strength with [G]scorn, less than [D]nothing
[C]So when I fear what I don’t [G]under[D]stand
[C]I’ll trust the [G]One who holds the [D]world{,} in His [C]hands


Chorus:
[Em]Behold our [G]God! [D/F#]Sovereign and [Am]good
[Em]Matchless in [G]power,{,} the [C]King over all the earth
[Em]Fear not, my [G]soul! [D/F#]Trust in His [Am]plan
Over [Em]all the [G]world, God [C]reigns
Behold our [G]God [|      | D/F#      |      | C      |      | G      |]


Verse 2:
[Bm]Over [C]sin’s curse on [G]me, over [D]laws I could not [Bm]keep
God, the [C]Judge has de[G]clared{,} all my [D]debts relieved
[Bm]Sin re[C]mains close at [G]hand, pressing [D]in with its de[Bm]mands
But in my [C]Savior’s risen [G]life,{,} I find [D]victory
[C]So when I’m faced with guilt{,} and [G]sin’s do[D]main
[C]I’ll trust the [G]One whose death{,} has [D]broken my [C]chains</text>
