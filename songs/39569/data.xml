[C     | F     | Am     | G]

Verse 1:
[C]When we were [Cmaj7]dead in our trans[Em]gressions
[G]Jesus, You [C]came to bring us back to [Em]God
[G]You [Am7]    canceled the debt that stood a[Em7]gainst us
Set it a[C]side, nailing it to the c[Em]ross
[G]Now with [F]joy we can pro[G]claim [Gsus]

Chorus:
[Fmaj7]You’ve over[C]come the grave
[G]You took our [Am]curse away
[F]There is no [C]other name{,} by [Am]which we’re [Gsus]saved
[Fmaj7]For in Your [C]death we died
[G]In You we [Am]have new life
[F]Jesus, Your [G]name alone [||:]can [C]save [F    | Am    | G    :||]

Verse 2:
[C]Now death has [Cmaj7]lost its sting for[Em]ever
[G]Because You a[C]rose we do not hope in v[Em]ain
[G]You [Am7]    defeated every evil p[Em7]ower
Disarming them [C]all{,} bearing our guilt and [Em]shame
[G]And for[F]ever we’ll pro[G]claim [Gsus]

Bridge:
In Your [F]name there is [C]freedom,{,} [G]life and [Am]peace
In the [F]name ab[C]ove all [G]names
In Your [F]name there is [C]power,{,} [G]darkness [Am7]flees
At the [F]name ab[C]ove all [G]names</text>
