		<text>VERSE 1:
The [F#m]news of Jesus Christ, the crucif[D/F#]ied
[A]Risen, reigning at the Father’s [C#7/G#]side
Is [F#m]foolishness to those who cannot [D/F#]see
[A]Blinded by the lies they have bel[C#7/G#]ieved

PRE-CH:
So, [F#m]let the Church arise,{,} [D/F#]let the anthem ring
Till [A]all the world has heard{,} of Christ the [C#7/G#]Risen King
The [F#m]song of the redeemed{,} [D/F#]boldly we shall sing
The [A]hope of all the world{,} is Christ the [C#7/G#]Risen King!

CHORUS:
[D]We, we are not a[A]shamed{,} for the [Bm]gospel is the power of God to [F#m]save [E]
Yes, [D]we, we are not a[A]shamed{,} for we [Bm]have no other Savior to pro[F#m]claim [E]
[D]Christ a[A/C#]lone, the [Bm]Life, the T[E/G#]ruth, the W[F#m]ay

TURN:
[F#m    | E/G#    | A    | B7    | F#m    | E/G#    | A    | B7    | B7]

VERSE 2:
The [F#m]enemies of God are in a r[D/F#]age
Op[A/C#]posing Him, their efforts are in [C#7/E#]vain
Through [F#m]every age the gospel will en[D]dure
The [A/C#]Spirit’s with the Church forever[C#7/G#]more [(to pre-chorus)]

LAST CH:
[D]We, we are not a[A]shamed{,} for we [Bm]have a sure foundation in His [F#m]grace [E]
Yes, [D]we, we are not a[A]shamed
For we [Bm]have a great salvation in His [F#m]name [E]
[D]Christ a[A/C#]lone, the [Bm]Life, the T[E/G#]ruth, the W[F#m]ay</text>
