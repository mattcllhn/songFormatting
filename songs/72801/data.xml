		<text>Verse 1
When troubles [Bb]come when darkness [Cm7]crowds
When fortunes[Bb/D] fail and loss sur[Eb]rounds
My soul is [Bb]weak but Christ is [Cm7]strong
And so to [Bb/D]Him I leave it [Eb]all
For [F]He Who [Bb/D]holds all [Eb]things   Can [F]bear each [Bb/D]care I[Eb] bring


Chorus 1 
So I lay it [Bb]all on [Gm]Jesu[F]s
Steadfast is the [Eb]love of [Gm]Je - [F]sus
[Gm]He hears my [F/A]cry He's [Cm]faith[Bb]ful   [F]I lay it [Eb]all on [F]Je - [Eb]sus[Gm7]


Verse 2
When questions[Bb] rise when faith wears[Cm7] thin
When fears come [Bb/D]fast and truth grows [Eb] dim
The One wh[Bb]o saved will not for[Cm]sake
I'll trust His [Bb/D]Word and trust His [Eb] way
For [F]He Who [Bb/D]bore my [Eb]blame    Can [F]bear each [Bb/D]care I [Eb] name


Bridge
[Eb]I am we[Bb]ak You are st[Gm]rong
Jesus c[F]ome and take it a[Eb]ll
All my ca[Gm]res I cast on Y[F]ou


Tag
[Eb]I lay it all, [Gm]I lay it all[F] on Jesus</text>
