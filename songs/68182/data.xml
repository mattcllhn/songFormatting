VERSE 1:
Come, [Am]Holy Spirit, my [F]soul assure
Re[C/G]lieve my fears that [G]I no more

That my [C/G]debt is paid, that I’ve [G]been made free
O [Am]Comforter, in [F]me reside
When the [C/G]tempter speaks, be my [G]faithful guide
Show Your [Am]promise is for [F]me secured
For the [C/G]battle be my [G]heavenly sword

CHORUS:
Blessed as[F]surance, [Am]   Jesus is[G] mine!
Oh, what a [F]foretaste [Dm]   of glory d[Am]ivine! [G]
Heir of sal[F]vation, [Am]   purchase of[G] God
Born of His [F]Spirit, [Dm]   washed in His[C] blood

VERSE 2:
Il[Am]lumine me with the [F]Savior’s light
To dis[C/G]pel my thoughts in the [G]blackest night
In [Am]darkest hour to my [F]soul reveal
The [C/G]wounds which all my [G]sorrows heal
Im[Am]press that seal, His [F]image leave
And [C/G]by Your pow'r to His [G]grace I’ll cleave
Un[Am]til faith be sight and [F]prayer be praise
When be[C/G]holding Jesus [G]face to face

BRIDGE:
[F]This my story, [C]this my song: [G]born of Spirit, [Am]washed in blood
This my [F]story, [C]this my song: [G]in my Savior, [Am]I belong
