[C6    Em   | D   Bm   | C6   G  | D   Bm7  | C6   Em  | D   Bm  | C   G  | D]

VERSE1:
Your [G]Spirit had awakened{,} our l[Gmaj7]ifeless hearts to see
The [G6]King in brilliant glory,{,} re[C/G]vealed in majesty
We were [G]ruined in Your p[D]resence{,} and t[Em]earing at the s[C]eams
Our [G]eyes had gazed upon the King of k[D]ings

CHORUS:
We [C6]fall d[Em]own in [D]awe of You [Bm7]
We [C6]fall d[G]own und[D]one [Bm7]
We [C]fall d[Em]own bef[D]ore you, Lord, [Bm7]    un[C]done [G   | D]

VERSE 2:
Our h[G]ands had crafted idols,{,} our [Gmaj7]lips had spoken lies
[G6]Every wayward thought we had{,} a[C/G]gainst us testified
But [G]You were rich in m[D]ercy
To pro[Em]vide what You de[C]mand
And [G]now on Christ, the solid rock, we s[D]tand

BRIDGE:
[C]Ho[G]ly,   [Em]Ho[D]ly,   [C]Ho[G]ly O[D]ne           [Bm]
[C]Ho[G]ly,   [Em]Ho[D]ly,   [C]Ho[G]ly O[D]ne,   You [Bm]are
[C]Ho[G]ly,   [Em]Ho[D]ly,   [C]Ho[G]ly O[D]ne,   You [Bm]are
[C]Ho[G]ly,   [Em]Ho[D]ly,   [C]Ho[G]ly O[D]ne
