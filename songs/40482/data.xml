		<text>CHORUS (x2):
He put breath in my body I was life - less
He gave grace to this heathen like Cy - rus
I was sightless - He opened my eyelids
Now I can treasure Christ price - less

VERSE 1:
I feel the invincible One killing my sin
Healing my wounds with the blood that He willingly shed
I want the lifestyle - of a Christ child
Lost in the waves till the cross was my lighthouse
I feel the magnificent One nailed to the rack
Hit with the lash to put righteousness on my back
The war-cry of one born from the sky
“Let the cross be the only thing caught by my eye”
I feel the unbreakable One killing my lust
Sweating drops like blood while He kneels in the dust
LORD let me eyes behold the price that I owed 
As he lay in the garden and battles for my soul
I feel the omnipotent One bring in the calm
The perfect storm stilled while He lifts up His palm
Now I drink living water till my sin is slaughtered
Holding fast to the hope He’ll finish what He started 

VERSE 2:
I know the unstoppable One shows me His love
I see it in Leviticus when they sprinkle the blood
See I was born ruined, my heart is raw sewage
And we were separated until He saw fluid
I know the all-powerful One sees every flaw
How I spurned and spit upon every law
He had a plan though, to remove my punishment
He sent the Mediator and made a New Covenant
I know the unchangeable One gave up His Son
To bring to completion the work He had begun
The sacrificial system was only a shadow
To take away sin you need more than some cattle
But the Son is perfect, infinite and eternal
So the Son can absorb a limitless inferno
That’s what the Jews were missing, that’s who Messiah is
The purpose of life is to treasure Him as priceless
