		<text>Intro:
[Am    F    | C2    G    | Am    F    | C2    G]

Verse 1:
The [Am]light of day was [F2]cloaked by night, and [C2]heaven closed its [Gsus  G]eyes
[Am]Wrath unspared for [F2]countless sins, the [C2]guiltless [G/B]cruci[Am7]fied
[Am]Hands of kindness [F2]driven through, [C2]back on splintered [Gsus   G]beam
The [Am]holy curtain [F2]torn in two, a[C2]tonement made for [G   Em]me

Chorus:
[Am]Hail [F] [ ]the [C2]perfect [G]Lamb of [Am   F]God
A [C2]kingly [G]ransom [Am   F]paid
When [C2]You, my [G]Lord, were [D]slain
[Am]Love[F], [ ]un[C2]rivaled [G]here, dis[Am]play[F]ed
[C2]Calls my [G]heart to [Am   F]praise
The [C2]perfect [G]Lamb [6/4]of [Am]God

Verse 2:
[Am]Insults mock the [F2]Son of God, the [C2]angels are rest[Gsus    G]rained
But [Am]all the cup must [F2]be endured, for [C2]sinners [G/B]to be [Am7]saved
Can [Am]grace prevail in [F2]such a day, of [C2]scandal and of [Gsus    G]scorn?
But [Am]with a cry, &quot;For[F2]give!&quot; You claim
[C2]Traitors as Your [G  Em (to chorus)]own

Verse 3:
[Am]As You drew Your [F/A]final breath
My [Am]debt was satis[F/A]fied
And [Am]love divine, in [F2]glorious might
Would [C2]vanquish death and [G   Em (to chorus)]rise</text>
