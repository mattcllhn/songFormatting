		<text>VERSE 1: 
The[A] splendor of a king [F#m7]clothed in majesty
Let all the earth re[D2]joice, all the earth rejoice
He [A]wraps himself in light 
And d[F#m7]arkness tries to hide
And trembles at his v[D2]oice, trembles at his voice  

CHORUS: 
How [A]great is our God!
Sing with me: How [F#m7]great is our God!
And all will see how [Dmaj7]great, how g[E]reat is our G[A2]od!

VERSE 2: 
And [A]age to age he stands, and [F#m7]time is in his hands
Beginning and the e[D2]nd, beginning and the end
The G[A]odhead three in one, [F#m7]Father, Spirit, Son
The Lion and the L[D2]amb, the Lion and the Lamb

BRIDGE: 
[A]Name above all names, [F#m7]worthy of all praise
My [Dmaj7]heart will sing: How g[E]reat is our [A]God</text>
