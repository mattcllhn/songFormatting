		<text>Chorus 1:
It's all about [Bm]You   [G]  [D]Jes[A]us
And all this is [Bm]for You   [G]
For Your g[D]lory and Your f[A]ame
It's not about [Bm]me   [G]
As if [D]You should do things [G]my way
[Bm]You alone are [A]God
And I surr[G]ender to Your w[D]ays   [G     Bm    A]


Verse 1:
[D]Jes[G]us l[A]over of my s[D]oul
[G]All consuming f[D]ire
Is in Your [Asus]gaze   [A]
[D]Jes[G]us [A]I want You to k[Bm]now
[G]I will follow [D]You all my [Asus]days   [A]
For [D]no one else
In [G]history is [Bm]like [G]You
And [D]history its[A]elf belongs to [G]You
[D]Alpha and Om[G]ega
You have l[Bm]oved [G]me
And [D]I will share et[G]ernity with [Asus]You   [A]
