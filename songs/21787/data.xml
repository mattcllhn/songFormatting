[||:F  |  F  |  Bb  |  C  :||]

Verse 1: 
[F]God moves i[F/E]n myste[F/D]rious wa[F/C]ys
His w[Bb]onders to perf[C]orm
He p[F]lants His f[F/E]ootsteps [F/D]in the se[F/C]a
And r[G#m7]ides upon the st[C]orm
D[Bb]eep in His dark and h[C]idden mines
With ne[F]ver-f[F/E]ailing ski[F/D]ll  [F/C] 
He f[G#m7]ashions all His br[F/A]ight designs
And w[Bb]orks His sovereign w[C]ill

Refrain: 
O f[Bb]earful s[C]aints new c[F/A (2/4)]ourage ta[Bb]ke
The cl[G#m7]ouds you so much dr[C]ead
Are [Bb]big with me[C]rcy [F/A (2/4)]and will br[Bb]eak
In bl[G#m7]essings [C]on your [F]head
{new_page}
Verse 2: 
[F]Judge not the [F/E]Lord by f[F/D]eeble s[F/C]ense
But tr[Bb]ust Him for His gr[C]ace
Beh[F]ind a fr[F/E]owning pr[F/D]ovid[F/C]ence
He h[G#m7]ides a smiling f[C]ace
Judge n[Bb]ot the Lord by f[C]eeble sense
But tr[F]ust Him [F/E]for His gr[F/D]ace  [F/C] 
Beh[G#m7]ind a frowning pr[F/A]ovidence
He [Bb]hides a smiling f[C]ace

Verse 3: 
Godâ€™s p[F]urpose[F/E]s will r[F/D]ipen f[F/C]ast
Unf[Bb]olding every h[C]our
The [F]bud may [F/E]have a b[F/D]itter t[F/C]aste
But s[G#m7]weet will be the fl[C]ower
Blind [Bb]unbelief is s[C]ure to err
And sc[F]an His [F/E]work in [F/D]vain  [F/C] 
God [G#m7]is His own int[F/A]erpreter
And [Bb]He will make it pl[C]ain</text>
		<searchtext>intro verse 1 god moves in mysterious ways his wonders to perform he plants his footsteps in the sea and rides upon the storm deep in his dark and hidden mines with neverfailing skill he fashions all his bright designs and works his sovereign will refrain o fearful saints new courage take the clouds you so much dread are big with mercy and will break in blessings on your head verse 2 judge not the lord by feeble sense but trust him for his grace behind a frowning providence he hides a smiling face judge not the lord by feeble sense but trust him for his grace behind a frowning providence he hides a smiling face verse 3 gods purposes will ripen fast unfolding every hour the bud may have a bitter taste but sweet will be the flower blind unbelief is sure to err and scan his work in vain god is his own interpreter and he will make it plain</searchtext>
