Verse 1: 
Every [B]morning that breaks, there are [E/B]mercies a[B]new 
Every [E/B]breath that I [B]take, is your [C#/G#]faithfulness [F#]proved 
And at the [B]end of each [G#m]day, when my [E]labors are [A]through 
I will [B/C#]sing [C#m]of Your [F#sus]merc[F#]ies a[B    | B    | E/G#    | F#sus]new 

Verse 2: 
When I’ve [B]fallen and [G#m]strayed, there were [E]mercies a[B]new 
For you [E]sought [F#]me in [G#m]love, and my [C#/E#]heart you purs[F#sus]ued 
In the [B]face [F#/A#]of my [G#m]sin,{,} Lord, You [E]never withd[A]rew 
So I [B/C#]sing [C#m]of Your [F#sus]merc[F#]ies a[B    |]new

Chorus: 
And [F#/A#]Your [G#m]mer[F#]cies, they will [E]never [B]end 
For ten [G#m]thousand [F#]years they’ll rem[E]ain 
[F#]And when [G#m]this world’s [F#]beauty{,} has [E]passed a[D#m]way 
Your [D]mer[E]cies will [A]be unch[C#m7]anged [| F#sus] 

Verse 3: 
And when the [B]storms [F#/A#]swirl and [G#m]rage, there are [E]mercies a[B]new 
In af[E]flic[F#]tion and [G#m]pain,{,} You will [C#/E#]carry me [F#sus]through 
And at the [B]end [F#/A#]of my [G#m]days, when Your [E]throne fills my [A]view 
I will [B/C#]sing [C#m]of Your [F#sus]mer[F#]cies a[C#m]new  [| B/D#] 
I will [E]sing of Your [F#7sus]mercies a[B    |]new</text>
