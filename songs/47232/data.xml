		<text>Verse 1:
[F]Nothing can tear us f[Am]rom
The g[F]rip of His mighty l[Am]ove
We've [F]only glimpsed His vast affection
Heard w[Am]hispers of His heart and passion
It's p[G]ouring out

Chorus:
[F]      His love is deep His love is wide and it covers us
[C]     His love is fierce His love is strong it is furious
[F]      His love is sweet His love is wild
And it's waking hearts [C]   to life

Verse 2:
The [F]Father loves and sends His S[Am]on
The [F]Son lays down His life for [Am]all
He l[F]avishes His love upon us
He c[Am]alls us now His sons and daughters
He's r[G]eaching out

Bridge:
[Am]     Yeah You're waking my h[G]eart to life
You are waking me  [F]   to life
With Your l[Am]ove
With Your l[G]ove
With Your l[F]ove</text>
