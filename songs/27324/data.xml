		<text>Chorus:
There’s [F]nothing [D/F#]better than J[G]esus
How [F]happy are the [C]ones{,} who be[G]long to You
There’s [F]nothing [D/F#]better than J[G]esus
The [F]one who is the [C]life,{,} and the [G]only truth
And [F]when You come, You [C]fill our lives with fr[Dsus]uit
[D]   There’s nothing better than Y[F]ou [D/F#   | G     | F   C   | G]

Verse 1:
[C]   What a beautiful w[G]orld{,} You’ve made for [D]us [| D]
[C]   Filled with wonderful g[G]ifts{,} that show Your l[D]ove [| D]
The m[Am]ountains and the va[Bm]lleys, the pl[C]anets and the s[D]tars
[Am]   But none of these can comp[C]are{,} with who You [D]are [| D]

Verse 2:
[C]   What a beautiful th[G]ing{,} You’ve done for [D]us [| D]
[C]   Came to die for our s[G]ins upon the c[D]ross [| D]
You l[Am]ove the weak and h[Bm]umble, who r[C]un to You for h[D]elp
[Am]   You have the power to s[C]ave{,} like no one [D]else [| D]

Spoken:
[G]Planets and oceans, [F]towering [C]trees
[G]Jesus is greater than [F]all of [C]these
[G]Armies and airplanes, [F]princes and [C]kings
[G]Jesus is stronger than [F]every[C]thing
[G]Presents and birthdays, [F]Jesus is [C]better
[G]Forever and always, [F]Jesus is [C]better
[G]Better than anything [F]you can im[C]agine
[G]Jesus is better than [F]all! [C]
