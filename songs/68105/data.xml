		<text>VERSE 1: 
I come in simp[C]licity
longing for [F]purity
to worship [Am]You in Spirit and [G]truth,
only [F]You.
Lord, strip it [C]all away
till only [F]You remain.
I'm coming [Am]back to my first [G]love,
only [C]You.


CHORUS: 
You're the [F]reason I [G]sing,
the [C/E]reason I [Am7]sing.
Yes, [F]my heart will [G]sing
how I l[C]ove You. [Csus2  C] 
And for[F]ever I'll [G]sing,
for[C/E]ever I'll [Am7]sing.
Yes, [F]my heart will [G]sing
how I l[C]ove You.
