[Em]We three kings of [B]Orient [Em]are, bearing gifts we [B]traverse a[Em]far,
[Em]Field and [D]fountain, [G]moor and [Em]mountain, [Am]following [B]yonder [Em]star.


Chorus:
[D]O, [G]star of wonder, [C]star of [G]night, star with loyal [C]beauty [G]bright,
[G]Westward [D]leading, [C]still pro[D]ceeding, [G]guide us to thy [C]perfect [G]light.


Verse 2:
[Em]Born a King on [B]Bethlehem's [Em]plain, gold I bring to [B]crown Him a[Em]gain,
[Em]King for[D]ever, [G]ceasing [Em]never,{,} [Am]over us [B]all to [Em]reign.


Verse 3:
[Em]Frankincense to [B]offer have [Em]I, incense owns a [B]deity [Em]nigh;
[Em]Prayer and [D]praising, [G]voices [Em]raising, [Am]worshiping [B]God on [Em]high.


Verse 4:
[Em]Myrrh is mine; its [B]bitter per[Em]fume, breaths a life of [B]gathering [Em]gloom;
