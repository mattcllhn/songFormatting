[G       | C2       | G       | C2]

Verse 1:
Before You [Em7]gave us life and breath, You numbered [G]all our days
You set Your [Em7]gracious love on us, and chose us [G]to be saved
This fleeting [C2]life is passing by, with all its [G/B]joys and pain
But we be[C2]lieve to live is Christ{,} and death is g[Dsus]ain [D]

Chorus:
To [G]live is Christ, to [C2]die is gain
In [G]every age, this [C2]truth remains
We [Em7]will not fear, we’re [C2]unashamed
To [Am7]live [Gmaj7/B]is      [C2]Christ, to die is [G]gain [C2]

Verse 2:
And though we [Em7]grieve for those we love, who fall as[G]leep in Christ
We know they’ll [Em7]see the Savior’s face, and gaze in[G]to His eyes
So now we [C2]grieve, yet we don’t grieve, as those who [G/B]have no hope
For just as [C2]Jesus rose again{,} He’ll raise His [Dsus]own [D (to chorus)]

Inst:
[||: Em7    | C2      | Am7    Em7  | Dsus     D :||]

Verse 3:
And now we’re [Em7]longing for the day, we’ll see the [G]Lamb once slain
Who saved a [Em7]countless multitude, to glori[G]fy His name
We’re yearning [C2]for the wedding feast, of Jesus [G/B]and His bride
His nail-scarred [C2]hands will finally{,} bring us to His [Dsus]side [D]</text>
