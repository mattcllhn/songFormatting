I [Em]come, God, I [D]come
I r[Am]eturn to the [Em]Lord
The one who’s[C] broken
The one who’s [G]torn me apart [D] 
You strike[Em] down to bind me[D] up
You say you[Am] do it all in [Em]love
That I might [C]know you [G]in your suff[D]ering


chorus: 
Though you [C]slay [G]me
[Em]Yet I will [D]praise you
Though you [C]take from[G] me
[Em]I will bless your[D] name
Though you [C]ruin [G]me
[Em]Still I will wo[D]rship
Sing a [C]song to the one who’s [D]all I n[C]eed

verse 2: 
My [Em]heart and flesh may [D]fail
The [Am]earth below give [Em]way
But with my [C]eyes, with my [G]eyes I’ll see the [D]Lord
Lifted [Em]high on that [D]day
Behold, the[Am] Lamb that was [Em]slain
And I’ll [C]know every [G]tear was worth it [D]all

bridge: 
[Am]Though tonight I’m [Em]crying out
[D]Let this cup pass [Am]from me now

You’re [C]enoug[G]h for me [Em] 
You’re [C]enoug[G]h for me [D]
