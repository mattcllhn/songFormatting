		<text>INTRO:
[Am7     | Dm7     | Am7     | Dm7]

Verse 1:
[Am]   Out of the depths, O Lord, I [Fmaj7]cry to You
[Am]   When I am tempted to des[Fmaj7]pair
[Dm7]   Though I might fail to trust Your [C/E]promises
[Fmaj7]   You never fail to hear my [Gsus]prayer [G]
[Dm]   And if You [Am]judged my sin, [G] [ ]I’d never [Fmaj7]stand again
[Dm]   But I see [C/E]mercy in Your [F]hands

Chorus:
So [G]more than [Am]watchmen for the [F2]morning
I will [C]wait for You, my [G]God
When my [Am]fears come with no [F2]warning
In Your [C]Word I’ll put my [G]trust
When the [Am]harvest time is [G]over{,} and I [F2]still see no fruit
I will [Dm7]wait, I will [Gsus]wait [G] [ ]for [Am]You [| Dm7]

VERSE 2:
[Am]   The secret mysteries be[Fmaj7]long to You
[Am]   We only know what You re[Fmaj7]veal
[Dm7]   And all my questions that are [C/E]unresolved
[Fmaj7]   Don't change the wisdom of Your [Gsus]will [G]
[Dm]   In every [Am]trial and loss, [G] my hope is [Fmaj7]in the cross
[Dm]   Where Your com[C/E]passions never [F]fail</text>
