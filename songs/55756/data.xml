		<text>Verse 1:
Blood-bought [Am]children who are suff'ring
It won't be [C]long, it won't be long
Storm-tossed [Am]pilgrim, if you're struggling
It won't be [C]long, it won't be long

Verse 2:
Though your [Am]flesh is now decaying
It won't be [C]long, it won't be long
A new [Am]body God is making
It won't be [C]long, it won't be long

Chorus:
[Dm]Glory a[F]waits for [C]all God's red[G]eemed
[Dm]Glory a[F]waits and we'll be [Am]free [(2x instrumental)]

Verse 3:
All you [Am]saints now bound in prison
It won't be [C]long, it won't be long
Here's your [Am]freedom: Christ is risen
It won't be [C]long, it won't be long

Inst.:
[Am     |       | C     |       | Am     |       | C     |       | Dm   C/E   | F   G   | Am]

Verse 4:
We are [Am]longing for Christ's appearing
It won't be [C]long, it won't be long
Tears will [Am]vanish when we see Him
It won't be [C]long, it won't be long
