		<text>It is good to give thanks to the LORD,
      to sing praises to your name, O Most High;
To declare your steadfast love in the morning,
      and your faithfulness by night,
To the music of the lute and the harp,
      to the melody of the lyre.
For you, O LORD, have made me glad by your work;
      at the works of your hands I sing for joy.</text>
