		<text>Intro:
[A     | C#m     | G     | Bm     | A     | C#m     | G     | Bm ]

Verse 1:
[A]Who has done good{,} [C#m] [ ]and [G]who has sought God? [Bm]
We h[A]ated and cursed{,} [C#m] [ ]and [G]called for Your blood [Bm]
We [E]claimed to be wise{,} as we g[F#m]loried in shame
We t[G]old ourselves lies, des[Bm]pising Your reign
And [D]love, Your l[A]ove, was f[E]ar from [D]us
And [D]love, Your l[A]ove, was f[E]ar from [(intro)]us

Verse 2:
Our m[A]ouths were like graves, [C#m] [ ]our [G]words were like darts [Bm]
Our b[A]odies were slaves{,} [C#m] [ ]to the [G]greed of our hearts [Bm]
We [E]thirsted for life as we w[F#m]asted our breath
Ent[G]angled in strife, we ru[Bm]shed to our death
And [D]love, Your [A]love, was [E]far from [D]us
And [D]love, Your [A]love, was [E]far from [(intro)]us

Verse 3:
The [A]foolish You loved, [C#m] [ ]the [G]faithless You saved [Bm]
The [A]lost You have found,[C#m] [ ]the w[G]orthless You raised [Bm]
The [E]blood of Your cross{,} and Yo[F#m]ur empty grave
Changed r[G]ebels to heirs{,} and s[Bm]inners to saints
And [D]love, Your [A]love, has [E]come to [D]us
And [D]love, Your [A]love, has [E]come to [A]us</text>
