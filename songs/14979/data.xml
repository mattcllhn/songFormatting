		<text>Verse 1:
I have t[C2]asted of a l[G/B]ove,
Sweeter th[Am7]an the honeyc[F]omb
And I have h[C2]eard the symphon[G/B]y
Of your wh[Am7]isper in my s[F]oul
And I am ruined for this w[C/E]orld,
For none comp[F]ares with You, my L[G]ord

Chorus:
For You have [Am]ca[F]-ptured m[C]e,
Comp[G]letely [Am]ca[F]-ptured m[C]e
And [G]I'm cons[Dm  F]umed [ ]with Y[Em]ou,
And only Y[G]ou, J[F2]esus

Verse 2:
There's a gr[C2]ace I can't res[G/B]ist,
Loving c[Am7]ords are drawing m[F]e
And there's a b[C2]eauty far bey[G/B]ond
What eyes of fl[Am7]esh could ever s[F]ee
For I've beheld with trembling j[C/E]oy
The sight of C[F]alv'ry's Scarlet R[G]ose</text>
