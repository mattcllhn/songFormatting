Verse 1:
[D]Dead in trans[G]gressions and [A]sins
Without [D]God, without [G]hope in this [Asus   A]world
[Bm]Then, the [G]glorious [D/F#]light{,} of Your [G]gospel broke [Asus   A]in
The [D]Father stood [G]up from His [A]throne
Opened His [D/F#]arms{,} as He [G]called out my [Asus   A]name
[Bm7]Grace irres[G]istible [A]drew me
Opened my [G]eyes to [Asus]see

Chorus:
You are the [D]way, You are the [Em7]truth, You are the [Bm7]life, Je[G]sus
The only [D]way, the only [Em7]truth, You are my [Bm7]life, Je[G]sus

Turn:
[D    G2/B    | C2       | D    G2/B    | C2]

Verse 2:
[D]You are the [G]source of new [Asus   A]life
The [D]giver of [G]every goo[Asus]d thing
[Bm7]Withholding [G]nothing
You [D/F#]lavish Your [G]kindness o[Asus]n me[A]
You [D]emptied Your[G]self, became [Asus   A]poor
[D/F#]Humbled and [G]poured out [Asus]to death [A]
Now [Bm7]highly ex[G]alted ab[A]ove all
Your name a[G]lone can [Asus (to chorus)]save

Bridge:
[D] [ ]You [Em]are the [D/F#]way, the [G]truth, the life (3X)
[D] [ ]You [Em]are the [D/F#]way, the [G]truth</text>
