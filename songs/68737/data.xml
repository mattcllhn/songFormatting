Verse 1:
When my [A]heart is weary, when my [F#m]soul is weak
When it [D]seems I can’t [E]traverse the trail [F#m]before me
I [A]survey the glory of your [F#m]agony
And I [D]find the will to [E]fight for what’s [F#m]before me
 ‘Cause you [D]ran the race, [E]enduring for your [F#m]glory

Chorus:
I [A]fix my [Amaj7/C#]eyes on [F#m  Dsus2]you, 
the [A]founder and the [Amaj7/C#]finisher of our [F#m  D]faith
I [A]fix my [Amaj7/C#]eyes on [F#m  D]you, 
the [A]solace in your [Amaj7/C#]suffering is my [F#m  D]strength

Verse 2:
As I [A]fight to follow, you’re my [F#m]righteous guide
And you [D]train me to [E]delight in all that’s [F#m]holy
Heal my [A]broken body, cure my [F#m]crooked stride
Throw off [D]every weight and [E]sin that clings so [F#m]closely
I will [D]run the race, [E]enduring for your [F#m]glory

Bridge:
You [A]help me [Amaj7/C#]breathe, you’re the only [F#m]life I [D]need
You [A]died for [Amaj7/C#]me, you’re the only [F#m]life I [D]need</text>
