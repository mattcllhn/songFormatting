		<description>The Wonderful Cross</description>
		<text>VERSE 1:
[D]When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of Glory died
My richest gain I count but loss
And pour contempt on all my pride


VERSE 2:
[D]See from His head, His hands, His feet
Sorrow and love flow mingled down
Did ever such love and sorrow meet
Or thorns compose so rich a crown.


CHORUS:
[G]O the wonderful [D/F#]cross, O the [G]wonderful [D/F#]cross
Bids me [G]come and die and [D/F#]find that I
May [A]truly live
O the [G]wonderful [D/F#]cross, O the [G]wonderful [D/F#]cross
All who [G]gather here by [D/F#]grace draw near
And [A]bless Your name.

VERSE 3:
[D]Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast
Save in the death of Christ, my	God 	
All the vain things that charm 	me most
I sacrifice them to His blood 	

VERSE 4:
[D]Were the whole realm of nature mine
That were an offering far too small
Love so amazing, so divine
Demands my soul, my life, my all.
