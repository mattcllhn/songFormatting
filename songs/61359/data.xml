		<text>INTRO:
[G     | G     | C     | C ]

VERSE 1:
[G]On a starlit hillside, [C]shepherds watched their sheep
[G]Slowly, David's city [C]drifted off to sleep
But to [Am]this little town of [Em]no great renown
The [C]Lord had a promise to keep [G   | G   | C   | C]

Verse 2:
[G]Prophets had foretold it, a [C]mighty King would come
[G]Long awaited Ruler, [C]God's Anointed One
But the [Am]Sovereign of all{,} looked [Em]helpless and small
As [C]God gave the world His own Son

CHORUS:
And [G]who would have dreamed{,} or [C]ever foreseen
That [Em]we could hold [D]God in our [C]hands?
The [G]Giver of Life is [C]born in the night
Re[Em]vealing God’s [D]glorious [C]plan
To save the [G]world [| G   | C   | C]

VERSE 3:
[G]Wondrous gift of heaven: the [C]Father sends the Son
[G]Planned from time eternal, [C]moved by holy love
He will [Am]carry our curse{,} and [Em]death He’ll reverse
So [C]we can be daughters and sons</text>
