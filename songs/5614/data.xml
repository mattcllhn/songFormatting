Blest [F]be the [C]tie that [F]binds, our [Bb]hearts in [F]Christian [C]love;

Verse 2:
Be[F]fore our [C]Father’s [F]throne, we [Bb]pour our [F]ardent [C]prayers;
Our [C]fears, our [F]hopes, our [C]aims are [F]one, [Bb]our [F]com[Bb]forts [F]and [C]our [F]cares.


Verse 3:
We [F]share each [C]other’s [F]woes, our [Bb]mutual [F]burdens [C]bear;
And [C]often [F]for each [C]other [F]flows, [Bb]the [F]sym[Bb]pa[F]thi[C]zing [F]tear.


Verse 4:
When [F]we a[C]sunder [F]part,{,} it [Bb]gives us [F]inward [C]pain;

Verse 5:
This [F]glorious [C]hope re[F]vives, our [Bb]courage [F]by the [C]way;
While [C]each in [F]expec[C]tation [F]lives, [Bb]and [F]longs [Bb]to [F]see [C]the [F]day.


Verse 6:
From [F]sorrow, [C]toil and [F]pain, and [Bb]sin, we [F]shall be [C]free,
And [C]perfect [F]love and [C]friendship [F]reign, [Bb]through [F]all [Bb]e[F]ter[C]ni[F]ty.</text>
