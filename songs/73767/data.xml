		<text>INTRO:
[A]

VERSE 1: 
When I [F#m]stand accused by [E]my [         D]regrets
And the [A]devil roars his [E]empty [D]threats
I will [F#m]preach the gospel [E/G#]to [      A]myself
That [D]I am [A]not a [E]man [        A]condemned
For [D]Jesus [A]Christ is [E]my [    A]defense

CHORUS: 
My sin is [A]nailed [E]to the [F#m]cross
My [D]soul is [A]healed [E]by the [F#m]scars
The [D]weight of [A]guilt I [E]bear no [F#m]more
[D]Praise the [A]Lord, [E]praise the [A]Lord

TURN:
[A   E  F#m   D  A   E   A]

VERSE 2: 
When my [F#m]doubt and shame hang [E]over [D]me
Like the [A]arrows of the [E     D]enemy
I will [F#m]run again to [E/G#   A]Calvary
That [D]rugged [A]hill of [E]hell's [     A]defeat
My [D]fortress [A]and my [E    A]victory

BRIDGE: 
It is [D]finished, sin is [F#m]vanquished
[      A]Hallelujah, praise the [E]Lord
All the [D]glory, all the [F#m]honor
To my [A]Savior, Christ the [E]Lord

VERSE 3: 
When I [F#m]stand before the [E]throne at [D]last
His [A]blood will plead my [E    D]innocence
I will [F#m]worship Him with [E/G#]holy [A]hands
And [D]raise the [A]song that [E]never [A]ends
Of [D]Jesus [A]Christ, my [E             A]righteousness

CHORUS 2: 
My sin is [A]nailed [E]to the [F#m]cross
My [D]soul is [A]healed [E]by the [F#m]scars
Now [D]I'm [   A]alive [E      F#m]forevermore
[D]Praise the [A]Lord, [E]praise the [A]Lord
Oh [D]praise the [A]Lord, [E]praise the [A]Lord</text>
