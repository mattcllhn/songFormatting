Ac[G]cused in absence of wrong
My[Em] sin washed away[C] in Your [G]blood

Too [Bm]much to make [C]sense of it [G]all
I [Bm]know that Your l[C]ove breaks my [G]fall
The [D]scandal of grace, You [Em]died in my place
So my [C]soul will live


Chorus: 
Oh to be [G]like You
Give all I have just to k[D]now You
Jesus there's no one bes[C]ide You

Verse 2: 
[G]Death, where is your sting?
Your [Em]power is as d[C]ead as my [G]sin
The [G]Cross has taught me to live
And [Em]mercy, my [C]heart now to sing [G]
