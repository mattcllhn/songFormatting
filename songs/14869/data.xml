[(solo piano line) F# B D# B C# B C# B A# B A# B G# B G# B]

Verse 1:
My [B]Lord, I [F#/A#]did not [G#m7]choose You, for [B]that could [F#/A#]never [F#sus   F#]be
My [B]heart would [F#/A#]still re[G#m7]fuse You, had [E]You not [B/D#]chosen [F#sus    F#]me
You [G#m]took the sin that stained me, You [F#]cleansed me, made me new
Of [G#m]old You have ordained me, that [E]I should live in [F#]You


Chorus:
[B]Jesus, [D#m]You have [G#m]saved me
And [F#]taken all my [E]sin, all my sins [F#sus    F#]away
[B]Jesus, [D#m]You have [G#m]called me
Be[F#]fore the world be[E]gan, to glorify Your [F#sus    F#]name


Tag:
I was [C#m7]without hope and dead inside
[E]But You chose to [F#]save my [B        F#]life


Verse 2:
Un[B]less Your gra[F#/A#]ce had call[G#m7]ed me, and [B]taught my darkened [G#m7]mind
The [B]world would [F#/A#]have en[G#m7]thralled me, to Your [B]glories I’d be [G#m7]blind
My [G#m]heart knows none above You, for [F#]Your rich grace I thirst
I [G#m]know that if I love You, You [E]must have loved me [F#]first


[(Chorus)]


Inst.:
[B      Bmaj7 | B      Bmaj7 | G#m    G#m9    | G#m    D#m]
