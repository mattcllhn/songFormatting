		<text>Verse 1: 
[C]O holy night, the [F]stars are brightly [C]shining;
It is the [Am]night of the [G7]dear Savior’s [C]birth!
[C]Long lay the world in [F]sin and error [C]pin[C7]ing,
Till He ap[Em]peared and the [B7]soul felt its [Em]worth.
A [G7]thrill of hope,{,} the [C]weary soul rejoices,
For [G7]yonder breaks{,} a [C]new and glorious [C/G]morn.


Chorus 1: 
[Am]Fall on your [Em]knees,{,} O [Dm]hear the angel [Am]voices!
O [C  G7]night, di[C  F]vine!{,} O [C/E]night [G7] [ ]when Christ was [C]born!
O [G  G7]night, di[C  F]vine!{,} O [C]night, [G7] [ ]O holy [C]night!


Verse 2: 
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming,
Here came the wise men from Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus in lowly manger,
In all our trials born to be our Friend!

Chorus 2: 
He knows our need—to our weakness is no stranger.
Behold your King; before Him lowly bend!
Behold your King; before Him lowly bend!

Verse 3: 
[C]Truly He taught us to [F]love one a[C]nother;
His law is [Am]love and His [G7]Gospel is [C]peace.
[C]Chains shall He break, for the [F]slave is our [C]bro[C7]ther
And in His [Em]Name all op[B7]pression shall [Em]cease.
Sweet [G7]hymns of joy,{,} in [C]grateful chorus raise we,
Let [G7]all within us{,} [C]praise His holy [C/G]Name!


Chorus 3: 
[Am]Christ is the [Em]Lord!{,} O [Dm]praise His name for[Am]ever!
His [C  G7]pow’r and [C]glo[F]-ry{,} [C/E]e[G7]-vermore pro[C]claim!
O [G  G7]night, di[C  F]vine!{,} O [C]night, [G7] [ ]O holy [C]night!</text>
