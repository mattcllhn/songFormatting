[Fmaj7     | Fmaj7     | Am9     | Am9     | F2     | F2     | C     | C]

Verse 1:
[F2] [ ]When You lead me to the v[Am9]alley of vision
[F2] [ ]I can see You in the h[Am7     | G  Gsus4  G  |]eights
[F2] [ ]And though my humbling{,} wouldn’t [Am9]be my decision
[Dm7] [ ]It’s here Your [C/E]glory shines so b[F2]right
So let me [Em]learn{,} that the cross precedes the c[F2]rown
To be low is to be h[Em]igh
That the v[Am7]alley’s where{,} You m[Dm7]ake me more like Christ

Chorus:
Let me [F/G]find [G]Your [Am7]grace [F2] [ ]in the [C]valley
[G] [ ]Let me find Your [Am7]life [F2] [ ]in my [C]death
[G] [ ]Let me find Your [Am7]joy in my s[F2]orrow
Your [C]wealth in my [G]need
That You’re [Dm]near with e[Am/C]very b[Dm/B]reath
[E7] [ ]In the [Fmaj7    | Fmaj7    | Am9    | Am9    | F2    | F2    | C    | C]valley

Verse 2:
[F2] [ ]In the daytime there are [Am9]stars in the heavens
[F2] [ ]But they only shine at [Am7   | G  Gsus4  G  |]night
[F2] [ ]And the deeper that I [Am9]go into darkness
[Dm7] [ ]The more I [C/E]see their radiant l[F2]ight
So let me [Em]learn that my losses are my g[F2]ain
To be broken is to h[Em]eal
That the v[Am7]alley’s where{,} Your p[Dm7]ower is revealed</text>
