[Em  l  Em  l  Em  l  Em  l]

VERSE 1: 
[Em]O Lord we know you are [Cmaj7]sovereign
Earth and [D]heaven move at your com[C2]mand
[Em]And though the nations opp[Cmaj7]ose you
You will acc[D]omplish ev’rything you’ve [Asus]planned
[C]All those who plot to dethr[D]one you find
That their [G]strategies are [D/F#]all in [Em]vain
[C]Before your throne they will b[D]end their knees
And con[Am7]fess that Jesus surely reig[B7]ns


CHORUS 1: 
[G]Fill us with your Sp[D]irit, Lord
To b[Bm7]oldly speak your w[Em]ord
[G]Open unbel[D]ieving ears
And [Bm7]let your voice be h[Em]eard


VERSE 2: 
[Em]Lord, we’re aware of our [Cmaj7]weakness
And we’re [D]tempted to shrink back in [C2]fear
[Em]From threat of hostile re[Cmaj7]jection
Or ridi[D]cule of what we hold so [Asus]dear
[C]Lord, grant us boldness to s[D]peak the truth
That sal[G]vation is in [D/F#]Jesus’ [Em]name
The [C]cross may look foolish to[D] the world
But we [Am7]do not want to be ash[B7]amed

CHORUS 2: 
[G]Fill us with your S[D]pirit, Lord
Ex[Bm7]tend your hand to [Em]heal
[G]In the name of [D]Jesus show
Your [Bm7]pow’rful grace is [Em]real


Verse 3: 
[Em]O Lord, we know that the [Cmaj7]hour has come
When the [D]dead will hear your [C2]voice
And [Em]those who are in their [Cmaj7]graves shall rise
And to[D]gether will re[Asus]joice
[C]They will rejoice as they [D]finally see
The [G]day that death it[D/F#]self has [Em]died
[C]They will rejoice as they [D]finally see
The [Am7]Resurrection and the [B7]Life


Chorus: 
[G]Fill us with your S[D]pirit, Lord
Em[Bm7]power us to [Em]give
[G]Words of life to [D]all, O Lord
And [Bm7]cause the dead to [Em]live
