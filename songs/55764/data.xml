		<text>Intro:
[||: F#m     | A     | D    A/C#    | D     :|| ]

Verse 1:
[F#m]Hope that is seen is [A]no hope at all;{,} our [D]hope is in [A/C#]what is to c[D]ome
Christ [F#m]coming again to [A]bring us to heav'n, a [D]glorious [A/C#]end to our f[D]all
The [Bm]trials we [D]face will [G]fade
When [Bm]all our [D]tears are [G]washed away

Chorus:
Re[A]joice! Our [Em]hope is alive
Al[G]ive in Him, the [D]Son is risen
Re[A]joice! One [Em]day we'll arise
From [G]death to life, our [D]hope is alive in C[F#m]hrist

Verse 2:
[F#m]Hope isn't found in [A]things we possess
Nor [D]found in the [A/C#]praises of m[D]en
Our [F#m]will to survive won't [A]bring us new life
We [D]look past this [A/C#]world to the n[D]ext
[Bm]Coming [D]on the c[G]louds
We'll s[Bm]ee the [D]King and [G]all will bow

INSTR.:
[F#m     | A     | D    A/C#    | D     | Bm     | D     | G     |       |]

BRIDGE:
Re[A]joice! Our hope is alive in [G/A]Christ
Re[A]joice! Our hope is alive in [G/A]Christ
Re[A]joice! Our [Em]hope is alive
Re[G]joice! Our [D]hope is alive
Re[A]joice! Our hope is a[Em]live in [G]Christ [D]
