		<text>Intro:
[||: C#m    | A    | E    | E    :|| (2x)]

VERSE 1:
I could sooner count the [C#m]stars{,} than [A]number all Your [E]ways
Though I only know in [C#m]part,{,} that [A]part exceeds all [E]praise
As [A]sunlight fills the [E]skies{,} Your [F#m]goodness fills my [C#m]life
For [A]all Your precious [C#m]gifts{,} receive my [B]grateful[E]ness [(intro)]

VERSE 2:
I could sooner drink the [C#m]seas{,} than [A]fathom all Your [E]love
Like a never ceasing [C#m]stream{,} are [A]mercies through Your [E]Son
The [A]death of Christ al[E]one{,} de[F#m]serves eternal [C#m]song
For [A]such a love as [C#m]His{,} receive my [B]gratefuln[E]ess [|  E]

CHORUS:
No [B]praise is high enough,{,} no [C#m]thanks is deep enough
No [A]life is long en[E]ough{,} to tell of [B]all You’ve done
No [B]shout is loud enough,{,} no [C#m]words are strong enough
No [A]song is sweet en[E]ough{,} to sing Your l[B]ove [| B (intro)]

VERSE 3:
I could sooner turn back [C#m]time{,} than [A]turn Your heart a[E]way
Though the years go fleeting [C#m]by,{,} Your [A]mercies never [E]change
Be[A]fore You made the [E]sun{,} Your [F#m]love was set on [C#m]us
For [A]all Your faithful[C#m]ness{,} receive my [B]gratefuln[E]ess
