[Amaj9      | F#m7      | E      | E/D#]

Verse 1:
[A2]Come see the mournful grave, [F#m7]where once a body lay
[E]Our God in human form, [B/D#]by wrath and judgment torn
[A2]But He’s no longer here, [F#m7]His death has conquered death
[E]Our guilt has disapp[B/D#]eared,
In His for[A]giveness

Chorus:
[B]Jesus, [C#m]He has risen, [B]Jesus, He’s [C#m]alive
[B]Opened the [C#m]gates of [E]heaven
[A]His death has [Bsus]brought us life [Amaj9    | F#m7    | E    | E/D#]

Verse 2:
[A2]Come see what God has done, [F#m]for vile and wicked ones
[E]The Innocent is judged, [B/D#]unlovely ones are loved
[A2]Our joy is now complete, [F#m]for death has lost its sting
[E]And we are called to [B/D#]live
Life in His [A]victory

Bridge:
[C#m]Jesus, has [E]done enough
[F#m]Our hope can[A]not be shaken
[C#m]Because God [E]raised Him up
[F#m]We cannot [A]be forsaken
[C#m]Jesus, has [E]done enough
[F#m]Our hope can[A]not be shaken
[C#m]Because God [E]raised Him up
[F#m]We cannot [A]be forsaken</text>
