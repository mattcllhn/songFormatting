		<text>Verse 1:
On a [G]hill far a[D/F#]way stood an [C]old rugged c[G/B]ross,
The [C]emblem of [G/B]suffering and [D]shame;
And I [G]love that old [D/F#]cross, where the [C]dearest and [G/B]best
For a [C]world of lost s[G/B]inners was [D]slain.

Chorus:
So I'll [C]cherish the [G/B]old rugged [D]cross,
Till my [C]trophies at [G/B]last I lay [D]down;
I will [C]cling to the [G/B]old rugged [D]cross,
And [C]exchange it some [G/B]day for a [D]crown.

Verse 2:
O that [G]old rugged c[D/F#]ross, so [C]despised by the w[G/B]orld,
Has a [C]wondrous at[G/B]traction for [D]me;
For the [G]dear Lamb of G[D/F#]od{,} left His [C]glory ab[G/B]ove
To [C]bear it to d[G/B]ark Calva[D]ry.

Verse 3:
In that [G]old rugged c[D/F#]ross, stained with [C]blood so div[G/B]ine,
A [C]wondrous b[G/B]eauty I [D]see,
It was [G]on that old c[D/F#]ross, Jesus [C]suffered and d[G/B]ied,
To [C]pardon and s[G/B]anctify [D]me.

Ending:
And [C]exchange it some [D]day for a [C]crown. [G/B | D | G]
