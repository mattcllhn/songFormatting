		<text>Intro:
[F#m7     A | D2      | F#m7     A | D2 ]

Verse 1:
[F#m7]You bore our sins [A]in Your [D2]body
As [F#m7]You were hung on a [D2]tree,
So [F#m7]we might die [A]to reb[D2]ellion
And [A]live for him who set us f[A/E]ree [Esus]

Verse 2:
[F#m7]You were mocked [A]and rev[D2]iled
[F#m7]Suffering [A]in our p[D2]lace
[F#m7]Trusting all [A]to Your F[D2]ather
So [A]enemies could know Your [E]grace

Chorus:
We have been [Dmaj7]healed, justif[A]ied, made al[E]ive in the life of C[F#m]hrist
Righteous [Dmaj7]blood [A]covers every [E]sin
Risen L[Dmaj7]amb, heaven's l[A]ight, crucif[E]ied and now al[F#m]ive
In Your [Dmaj7]love, [A]You have drawn us [E]in

Verse 3:
[F#m7]Like straying sheep [A]we were w[D2]andering
[F#m7]Destitute [A]and al[D2]one
You [F#m7]sought us out [A]like a [D2]shepherd
You [A]carried us and brought us [E]home

Bridge:
All our [Bm7]sin for Your gr[F#m]ace, what a gl[E]orious exchange
All our [Bm7]sin for Your gr[F#m]ace, what a gl[E]orious exchange
All our s[Bm7]in for Your gr[F#m]ace, what a gl[D]orious exch[E]ange</text>
