[G]I will be [Am]still in [Dsus4]all He [D]does,
And [G]follow where [Am]He is [Dsus4   D]guiding
[C6]He is my God, [G/B]though dark my road, 
He [B]holds me that I shall not f[C2]all
And [G/B]so to [A7]Him I [Am7]leave [Dsus4] [ ]it al[G/B    A7    | Am7    D7sus4]l

[G]I know He w[Am]ill not [Dsus4]leave me [D] 
[C6]I take content, [G/B]what He has sent
His [B]hand can turn my griefs aw[C2]ay
And [G/B]patient[A7]ly I [Am7]wait [Dsus4] [ ]His d[G/B    A7    | Am7    D7sus4]ay
