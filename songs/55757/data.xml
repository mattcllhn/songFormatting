		<text>Intro:
[6/4 | C       4/4 | F/C       |       6/4 | C       4/4 | F/C       |       |]

Verse 1:
Why [C]should my doubts and questions r[F]ise{,} with [Am]every passing s[G]torm?
Why [C]does my heart believe the [F]lies{,} that [Am]God would do me h[G]arm?
To this [F]madness and my [G]unbelief, my G[Am]od, you have repl[D]ied:
&quot;I've not [F]spared my only [C]Son from grief, for [F]you, for y[G]ou He [(turn)]died!”

Turn:
[6/4 | Am   G   C/E  4/4 | F      |      6/4 | Am    G    C/E 4/4 | F      |      |]

Verse 2:
How [C]deep, how full, how sweet the [F]word{,} that [Am]good shall come to p[G]ass
That [C]every sorrow, sovereign [F]Lord, shall [Am]be transformed at [G]last
My [F]mind cannot per[G]ceive the end{,} nor [Am]make sense of the m[D]eans
But on [F]Christ the Lord my [C]soul depends{,} and [F]on His pr[G]omise [(turn)]leans

Verse 3:
Take [C]care, my soul, let praises r[F]ise{,} when [Am]God wills strife or p[G]eace
For[C]bid the unbelieving [F]lies{,} that [Am]overlook His [G]grace
Oh, [F]sing again of [G]Jesus Christ, His [Am]cruel and bitter [D]cross
Come, [F]give your all, pour [C]out your life, count [F]every[G]thing as [(instrumental)]loss

Instr:
[6/4 ||: F  C/E  G 4/4 | Am      |      :|| 6/4 Am  G  C/E 4/4 | F      |      |]

Verse 4:
Now, [C]what shall come between us, L[F]ord{,} and [Am]who can cut the [G]ties
That [C]You have made by shedding b[F]lood{,} with [Am]agonies and [G]cries?
Shall [F]humans, devils, [G]powers here{,} come [Am]take my source, my [D]life?
Have [F]peace, my soul, cast [C]off your fears{,} the [F]final w[G]ord is [(outro)]Christ

Outro:
[||: C       |       | F       |       :||  6/4  Am   G   C/E   4/4 | F]</text>
