Verse 1:
When this [D]world is [G]filled with [C]change [G]
And so [D]much I [G]can’t exp[C]lain
From the [D]peaks of [G]joy to the [Am]valleys of [Em]pain
Your [C]faithful[G]ness re[Dsus     D]mains
Your [C]faithful[G]ness re[Dsus     D]mains

Chorus:
So I’m calling [G]out{,} to You who [Dsus]called me  [D]
I’m holding [Em]on{,} to You who [C]holds me
I’m seeking [G]You{,} who came and [F]sought me in my sin
And You’ve been [Am]faithful again and a[Dsus    D]gain
So I’m calling [G     | F     | Am7     | Dsus   D   | (G)]out.

Verse 2:
When my [D]strength is [G]dry and [C]drained [G]
And my [D]hope be[G]gins to [C]wane
You are [D]always [G]near to [Am]lift me [Em]again
Your [C]faithful[G]ness re[Dsus    D]mains
Your [C]faithful[G]ness re[Dsus    D]mains</text>
