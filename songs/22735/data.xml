VERSE 1:
[A]Lord I’m [D]grateful, am[A]azed at what You’ve [D]done
[A]   My finest [D]efforts are f[G]ilthy r[D]ags

'Cause it’s g[A]race, there’s n[D]othing I can [A]do
To [D]make you love me m[A]ore
To [D]make you love me l[G]ess than you [D]do
And by f[A]aith I’m [D]standing on this st[A]one
Of [D]Christ and Christ al[A]one
Your r[D]ighteousness is [G]all that I n[D]eed, ‘Cause it’s g[A]race

[A]Called and [D]chosen when [A]I was far aw[D]ay
[A]   You brought me [D]into your [G]famil[D]y

[A]   Your lovingk[D]indness is l[G]ife to [D]me

BRIDGE:
[F#m]Grace loves the sinner
[D]In this world that’s all I’ll ever [A]be  [D     A     D]
But [F#m]Christ is the winner
[D]Over Satan, death, and sin in [G]me    [E]

VERSE 3:
[A]Freely [D]given but b[A]ought with priceless bl[A]ood
[A]   My life was r[D]ansomed at [G]Calvar[D]y

[A]   That I might [D]live for et[G]ernit[D]y
