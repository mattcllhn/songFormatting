Verse 1: 
You [D]take what is,
And you make it [G]beautiful.     [Bm]         [A] 
When [D]love floods in,
We're restored for[G]evermore.     [Bm]         [A]

Chorus: 
With breat[G]h that brings the dea[D]d to life,
With word[A]s that pierce the dar[Bm]k with light,
[G]Only by the bloo[D]d are we set free[A].
With me[G]rcy strong to ca[D]rry shame      
and na[A]il it to a tre[Bm]e,
You alo[G]ne hold the [A]power to rede[D]em!

Verse 2: 
No [D]guilt competes
With innocence [G]crucified.     [Bm]         [A] 
No [D]grave can hold what your grace has [G]justified.     [Bm]         [A]

Oh, with breat[G]h that brings the dea[D]d to life,
