Hold[Bb]ing close [F]forbi[2/4 C]dden thi[4/4 Dm]ngs
[Bb]Destit[F]ute, a [C]rebel [Dm]still,{,} a [Gm7]fool in [F]all my pr[C]ide

No [Bb]joy, no [C]hope, no[Dm] [ ]life

Verse 2:
[F]Where now are the friends{,} that [C]I had bou[Dm]ght
[Bb]Gone with every pen[C]ny lost[Dm]

[Bb]Sold out [F]to a wor[C]ld of li[Dm]es
[Bb]Oh, to s[F]ee Your fa[C]ce aga[Dm]in, it s[Gm7]eems so [F]distant [C]now
