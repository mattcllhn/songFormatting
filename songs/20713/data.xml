		<text>Verse 1:
[G]  You led me to the cross  [D/F#]
And I saw Your f[Em]ace of mercy
In that [C]  place of love
[G]  You opened up my eyes  [D/F#]
To believe Your s[Em]weet salvation
Where I'd [C]  been so blind
[A7/C#]   Now that I'm l[C]iving in Your all [G] forgiving love [D]
[A7/C#]   My every road [C] leads to[D/F#]  the cross [G]


Chorus:
[G]  Jesus [D/F#]  keep me near the cross  [Em   Em/D]
[A7/C#]   I won't forget [C] the love You've shown [G]
Saviour [D/F#]  teach me of the cross  [Em   Em/D]
[A7/C#]   I won't forget the love
[C]   I won't forget the love You've sh[G]own   [Gsus    G]


Verse 2:
[G]  And there's an empty tomb  [D/F#]
That tells me of Your r[Em]esurrection
And my [C]  life in You
[G]  The stone lies rolled away  [D/F#]
Nothing but those f[Em]olded grave clothes
Where Your [C]  body lay
[A7/C#]   Now that I'm l[C]iving as a ri[G]sen child of God [D]
[A7/C#]   My every road [C] leads to[D/F#]  the cross [G]
