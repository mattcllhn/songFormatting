[A2   C#m7   | A2   Bsus   | A2   C#m7   | A2   B   |]

Verse 1:
What [A2]wisdom once de[C#m7]vised the plan{,} where [A2]all our sin and [Bsus]pride
Was [A2]placed upon the [C#m7]perfect Lamb, who [A]suffered, [B]bled, and [E]died
The [F#m7sus]wisdom of a [E/G#]sovereign God, whose [A2]greatness will be [Bsus]shown
When [A2]those who cruci[C#m7]fied Your Son, re[A]joice a[B]round Your [E]throne

Chorus:
And [Bsus]oh, the [C#m7]glory of the [E]cross
That [Bsus]You would [F#m7sus]send Your Son for [A2]us
I [Bsus]gladly [C#m7]count my life as [E]loss
That I might come to [A2]know
The [F#m7sus]glory of, the [A2]glory of the [A2   C#m7   | A2   Bsus   |]cross.

Verse 2:
What [A2]righteousness was [C#m7]there revealed{,} that [A2]sets the guilty [Bsus]free
That [A2]justifies un[C#m7]godly men, and [A]calls the [B]filthy [E]clean?
A [F#m7sus]righteousness that [E/G#]proved to all, Your [A2]justice has been [Bsus]met
And [A2]holy wrath is [C#m7]satisfied, through [A]one at[B]oning [E]death.

Verse 3:
What [A2]mercy now has [C#m7]been proclaimed
For [A2]those who would be[Bsus]lieve?
A [A2]love incompre[C#m7]hensible, our [A]minds could [B]not con[E]ceive
A [F#m7sus]mercy that for[E/G#]gives my sin, then [A2]makes me like Your [Bsus]Son
And [A2]now I’m loved for[C#m7]evermore, be[A]cause of [B]what You’ve [E]done.</text>
