		<text>Verse 1:
I wanna be close close to Your side
So Heaven is real and death is a lie
I wanna hear voices of angels above
Singing as one

Chorus:
Hallelujah holy holy
God Almighty great I Am
Who is worthy none beside Thee
God Almighty great I Am

Verse 2:
I wanna be near near to Your heart
Loving the world hating the dark
I wanna see dry bones living again
Singing as one

Bridge:
The mountains shake before You
There demons run and flee
At the mention of Your name King of majesty
There is no pow'r in hell or any who can stand
Before the power and the Presence of the great I Am
The great I Am (5X)</text>
