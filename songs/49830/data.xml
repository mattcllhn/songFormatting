		<text>Leader: 
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
who has blessed us in Christ 
with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, 

All:
Even as he chose us in him 
before the foundation of the world, 
that we should be holy and blameless before him. 

Leader: 
In love he predestined us for adoption 
as sons through Jesus Christ, 
according to the purpose of his will, 
to the praise of his glorious grace, 
with which he has blessed us in the Beloved. 

All:
In him we have redemption through his blood, 
the forgiveness of our trespasses, 
according to the riches of his grace, 
which he lavished upon us, in all wisdom and insight
	
(Ephesians 1:3-8 ESV)

Leader:
May &quot;the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory... 
give you the Spirit of wisdom 
and of revelation in the knowledge of him, 
having the eyes of your hearts enlightened, 
that you may know what is the hope 
to which he has called you, 
what are the riches of 
his glorious inheritance in the saints,&quot;

(Ephesians 1:17-18 ESV)

All:
And may he grant us to be strengthened with power 
through his Spirit in our inner being, 
so that Christ may dwell in our hearts through faithâ€”
that we, being rooted and grounded in love, 
may have strength to comprehend with all the saints 
what is the breadth and length and height and depth, 
and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, 
that we may be filled with all the fullness of God.&quot;
