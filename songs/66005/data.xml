		<text>Verse 1: 
Of the Father's love begotten
Ere the worlds began to be
He is Alpha and Omega
He the source the ending He
Of the things that are that have been
And that future years shall see
Evermore and evermore

Verse 2: 
At His word they were created
He commanded it was done
Heaven and earth and depths of ocean
In their threefold order one
All that grows beneath the shining
Of the light of moon and sun
Evermore and evermore

Verse 3: 
O that birth for ever blessed
When the Virgin full of grace
By the Holy Ghost conceiving
Bare the Saviour of our race
And the babe the world's Redeemer
First revealed His sacred face
Evermore and evermore

Verse 4: 
O ye heights of heaven adore Him
Angel-hosts His praises sing
Powers dominions bow before Him
And extol our God and King
Let no tongue on earth be silent
Every voice in concert ring
Evermore and evermore

Verse 5: 
This is He whom seers and sages
Sang of old with one accord
Whom the writings of the prophets
Promised in their faithful word
Now He shines the long-expected
Let creation praise its Lord
Evermore and evermore

Verse 6: 
Hail Thou Judge of souls departed
Hail Thou King of them that live
On the Father's throne exalted
None in might with Thee may strive
Who at last in judgement coming
Sinners from Thy face shalt drive
Evermore and evermore

Verse 7: 
Christ to Thee with God the Father
And O Holy Ghost to Thee
Hymn and chant and high thanksgiving
And unwearied praises be
Honour glory and dominion
And eternal victory
Evermore and evermore
