		<text>Intro:
[C2      | Em7      | C2      | Em7]

Verse 1:
[C2]  Broken and def[Em7]iled
Clinging to our f[C2]ilth
We gloried in our [Em7]shame
Running far from [Fmaj7]You
Still Your mercy [Am]sought and [C  Csus]saved [G]us

Chorus:
Halle[F]lu[C]jah
We be[F]long [G]to [Am]You
You have [F]washed our [C]stains
And have [F]raised us [G]up with [Am]Christ
Precious [F]children [G]in Your [C2]eyes [| Em7    | C2    | Em7]

Turn:
[||: Am    C2    | C2    G    :|| (to chorus)]

Verse 2:
[C2]   You gave Your only [Em7]Son
Your joy and Your del[C2]ight
You nailed Him to the [Em7]cross
You crushed Him for our [Fmaj7]sin
How could You love [Am]us{,} like You [C  Csus]love [G]Him</text>
