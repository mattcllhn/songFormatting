[C2      | Fmaj7      | C2      | Fmaj7]

Verse 1:
Be[C2]fore the cross I kneel{,} and see the [Fmaj7]measure of my sin
How [C2]You became a curse for me,{,} though [Fmaj7]You were innocent
The [Am]magnitude of [Fmaj7]Your great love{,} was [C]shown in full deg[G]ree
When [F]righteous blood, the c[G]rimson [Am]spill
Rai[2/4]ned [Fmaj7]down from C[4/4]alva[Gsus4   G]ry

Chorus:
Oh, the [F]precious [C]blood{,} that [Am]flowed from Mercy’s [G]side
Washed [F]away my [C]sin{,} when [Am]Christ my Savior d[G]ied
Oh, the [F]precious [C]blood{,} [2/4]of [Em]Christ the c[4/4]rucif[F]ied
It [F]speaks for me bef[G]ore Your th[Am]rone
Wh[2/4]ere [F]I stand [G]jus[4/4]ti[C2]fied[| Fmaj7    | C2    | Fmaj7]

Verse 2:
And [C2]who am I that I should know{,} this [Fmaj7]treasure of such worth
My [C2]Savior’s pure atoning blood,{,} shed [Fmaj7]for the wrath I’d earned
For [Am]sin has stained my [Fmaj7]every deed,
My [C]every word and [Gsus   G]thought
What [F]wondrous love that m[G]akes me [Am]one
Your [Fmaj7]priceless blood has b[Gsus4   G (to chorus)]ought

Bridge:
A [C2]crown of thorns,{,} pierced [Am]hands and feet
A [C2/Bb]body bruised, and [Gsus4]Mercy’s p[G]lea
A [C2]crown of thorns,{,} pierced [Am]hands and feet
A [C2/Bb]body bruised, and [Gsus4]Mercy’s plea[| F2 (to chorus)]</text>
