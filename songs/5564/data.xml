		<text>Verse 1:
A[G]mazing [G7]grace, how [C]sweet the [G]sound
That [G]saved a [G7]wretch like [D]me.
I [G]once was [G7]lost, but [C]now I'm [G]found,
Was [Em]blind, but [D7]now I [C]see. [G]

Verse 2:
'Twas gr[G]ace that [G7]taught my [C]heart to [G]fear,
And [G]grace my [G7]fears re[D]lieved.
How [G]precious [G7]did that [C]grace a[G]ppear
The [Em]hour I [D7]first be[C]lieved![G]

Verse 3:
Through [G]many [G7]dangers, [C]toils and [G]snares
I [G]have al[G7]ready [D]come
'Tis [G]grace hath [G7]brought me [C]safe thus [G]far
And [Em]grace will [D7]lead me [C]home[G]

Verse 4:
When [G]we've been [G7]there ten [C]thousand [G]years
Bright [G]shining [G7]as the [D]sun,
We've [G]no less [G7]days to [C]sing God's [G]praise
Then [Em]when we've [D]first be[C]gun.[G]
