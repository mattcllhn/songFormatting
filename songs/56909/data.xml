[F/C  C   Dm/C   C   |   F/C   C   Am   G  |  F/G     C    Dm  C/E  F   |  C    G    C]

Verse 1: 
No [F/C]list of [C]sins I [Dm/C]have not [C]done, no [F/C]list of [C]virtues [Am]I pu[G]rsue,
No [F/G]list of [C]those I [Dm]am [C/E]not [F]like can earn my[C]self a [G]place with [C]you.
O[C/E] God! Be [G]merci[F]ful to [C]me. I[C/E] am a s[G]inner [G/F]through and [Am]through.
My [C/E]only [G]hope of [G/F]righteous[Am G F]ness is not in [C]me, but [G]only [C]yo[F/C]u

Verse 2: 
No [F/C]humble [C]dress, no [Dm/C]fervent [C]prayer, no [F/C]lifted [C]hands no [Am]tearful [G]song,
No [F/G]reci[C]tation [Dm]of [C/E]the [F]truth can just[C]ify a [G]single [C]wrong.
My [C/E]righteous[G]ness is [F]Jesus’ [C]life. My [C/E]debt was [G]paid by [G/F]Jesus [Am]death.
My [C/E]weary [G]load was [G/F]borne by [Am G F]Him And He [C]alone can [G]give me rest.

instrumental: 
[C  Dm  C/E  F |  C  G/B  Am   G | Am  G/B  C   Dm  |Am      F     G]

Verse 3: 
No separ[D]ation [Em/D]from the [D]world, no [G/D]work I [D]do, no [Bm/D]gift I [A/D]give
Can [G/D]cleanse my [D]conscience, [Em/D]cleanse [A/D]my h[G/D]ands,
I cannot [D]cause my [A]soul to [D]live[Em7].
But [D/F#]Jesus [A]died and [G]rose [D]again. The [D/F#]pow’r of [A]death is [G]over[D]thrown!
My [D/F#]God is [A]merci[A/G]ful to [Bm]me and [G]mercif[D/A]ul in [A]Christ [D]alone[Em7].

Tag: 
My [D/F#]righteous[A]ness is [G]Jesus’ [D]life. My [D/F#]debt was [A]paid by [A/G]Jesus [Bm]death.
My [D/F#]weary [A]load was [A/G]borne by [Bm-A-G]him, and He a[D/A]lone can g[A]ive me [Bm]rest,
And [G]He [D/A]alone can [A]give me [D]re[G/D]st. [D Em/D  D Em/D  D ]
