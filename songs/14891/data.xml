		<text>Intro:
[||: A     | F#m7     | Dmaj7     | Dmaj7     :||]

Verse 1:
How [A]sweet the [Bm7sus]place{,} where [A/C#]You dwell, O [D2]Lord
My [A]soul [Bm7sus]longs and faints for [F#m7    | Dmaj7]You
My [A]heart sings [Bm7sus]out a [A/C#]loud song of [D2]joy
For [A2]I have [Bm7sus]known the living [F#m7    | E]God

Chorus:
[A]I want to be where [Asus]You [A]are, [ E]O [ ]Lord [| Esus   E]
[F#m]I want to be where [D]You [F#m]are, [ Esus]O Lord
[E]     I’d rather have [F#m7]just one [C#m]day with [Bm]You
[Bm]     Than be anywhere [A     | F#m7     | A/D     | A/D]else


Verse 2:
There’s [A]no good [Bm7sus]thing{,} that [A/C#]You will with[D2]hold
From [A]those who [Bm7sus]live to follow [F#m7]You
I’d [A]rather [Bm7sus]be Your [A/C#]servant, O [D2]God
Than [A2]have the [Bm7sus]riches of this [F#m7    | E]world


Bridge:
[C#m]Those who follow [D]You{,} go from [A]strength to [E]strength
[C#m]Those who follow [D]You{,} are filled with [A    | A]joy
[C#m]Those who follow [D]You{,} go from [A]strength to [E]strength
[C#m]Those who follow [D]You{,} are filled with [Esus    | Esus]joy
