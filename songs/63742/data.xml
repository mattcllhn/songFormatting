		<text>Verse 1: 
Rock of [C]ages, [F/C]cleft for [C]me
Let me[C] hide [F]myself i[C]n thee 
Let the wa[F]ter and the [C]blood  
From thy wou[F]nded side which [C]flowed
Be of [C]sin the [F]double [C]cure         
Save from w[C]rath and m[G]ake me p[C]ure 

Verse 2: 
Not the [C]labors [F]of my [C]hands  
Can [C]fulﬁll the [F]laws [C]commands  
Should my [F]passion never [C]fade  
And my [F]efforts all be [C]weighed  
All for [C]sin could [F]not [C]atone  
You must [C]save and [G]you [C]alone  

Chorus: 
[C]Rock[C/B] of a[Am]ges  [C] 
No one [F]takes your [C]life 
Yet you [F]died that I might [C]live 
Costly [F]grace you freely [Am]give
Rock of ag[F]es  [C] 
You have [Dm]paid the [Am]price 
You were [F]cleft to cover [C]me
Let me [F]hide myself in [C]thee

{new_page}
Verse 3: 
Nothing [C]in my [F]hand I [C]bring  
Simply [C]to the [F]cross I [C]cling  
Naked [F]come to thee for [C]dress  
Helpless [F]look to thee for [C]grace  
Wretched [C]to the [F]fount I [C]ﬂy  
Wash me [C]Savior [G]or I [C]die

Bridge: 
And w[Am]hile[C/B] I d[C]raw my [F]final [C]breath 
I'll [Am]res[C/B]t up[C]on your [G]grace 
And w[Am]hen[C/B] I c[C]lose my [F]eyes in [C]death 
I'll [Am]wake[C/B] to [C]see your [G]face 

Interlude: 

 [Am] [C] [F] [C]      [Am] [C] [G] [E7]
