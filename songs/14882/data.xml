[E7    |      | Cmaj7     | D6 (2x)]

Verse 1:
[E7]        No more, my [Cmaj7]God, I [D6]boast no [E7]more
Of every[Cmaj7]thing my [D6]hands have [E7]done
I quit the [Cmaj7]hopes I [D6]held be[E7]fore
To trust the [Cmaj7]merits [D6]of Your [A]Son

Chorus:
[E] [ ]Now for His [G]love I [D]bear His [A]name
[E] [ ]My former [G]pride I [D]call my [A]shame
[E] [ ]What was my [G]gain I [D]count my [A]loss
And I [C]nail my [D6]glory to His [E7    |      | Cmaj7     | D6]cross

Verse 2:
[E7]        And by Your [Cmaj7]grace I [D6]will es[E7]teem
All things but [Cmaj7]loss for [D6]Jesus’ [E7]sake
Oh may my [Cmaj7]soul be [D6]found in [E7]Him
And of His [Cmaj7]righteous[D6]ness par[A]take

Verse 3:
[E7]        All of the [Cmaj7]works of [D6]my own [E7]hands
I dare not [Cmaj7]bring be[D6]fore Your [E7]throne
My faith res[Cmaj7]ponds to [D6]Your de[E7]mands
By pleading [Cmaj7]what my [D6]Lord has [A]done</text>
