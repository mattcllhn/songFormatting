		<text>Verse 1: 
I see the cr[E]oss and it's [A2]all I need to see
I see the c[C#m]ross and it c[A2]alls me to believe

Chorus: 
No other w[E]ay to be r[B]econciled
To rec[A2]eive complete forgiveness
No other ch[E]oice could have s[B]et us free
Could have p[A2]aid the price of justice
[F#m]So I come [E/G#]as I am
To the pl[A]ace where mercy [Bsus]meets me[B] 
I see the cr[E]oss [B/D#    A2    B] 
I see the cr[E5]oss [B/D#    A2    B] 


Verse 2: 
I see the cr[E]oss lifted h[A2]igh for all to see
I see the c[C#m]ross it's the l[A2]ove the nations need

Chorus: 
No other w[E]ay to be r[B]econciled
To rec[A2]eive complete forgiveness
No other ch[E]oice could have s[B]et us free
Could have p[A2]aid the price of justice
[F#m]So I come [E/G#]as I am
To the pl[A]ace where mercy [Bsus]meets me[B] 
I see the cr[E]oss [B/D#    A2    B] 
I see the cr[E5]oss [B/D#    A2    B]

BRIDGE: 
[F#m]  You [E/G#]suffered and [A2]died p[B]oured out Your [F#m]life
You s[E/G#]howed us the w[A2]ay to tr[B]uly be [F#m]great
Yet [E/G#]this just beg[A2]ins the F[B]ather's full [F#m]plan
Now [E/G#]there is a w[A2]ay to sh[B]are in Your r[E5]esurr[B/D#]ection
To l[A2]ive fore[B]ver thr[E5]ough Your [B/D#]death and l[A2]ife  [B] 
To share Your r[E5]esurr[B/D#]ection to l[A2]ive fore[B]ver
Thr[E5]ough Your [B/D#]death and l[A2]ife
[B]  I see the cr[E]oss  [A2]   I see the c[C#m]ross  [A2] 


ENDING: 
[B/D#   A/C#   B] I see the cr[E]oss  [B/D#   A/C#   B] 
I see the cr[E]oss  [B/D#   A/C#   B] 
I see the cr[E5]oss  [B/D#      A/C#        B] 
              (Resur-rection  live forever)
I see the cr[E5]oss               [B/D#             A2    B] 
              (Through Your death and life)
[(Repeat 3X)]
