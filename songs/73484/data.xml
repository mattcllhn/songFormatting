		<text>Verse 1: 

[G]The moon and stars they [D]wept
The morning sun was [Em]dead
The Savior of the [C]world was fallen
H[G]is body on the [D]cross
His blood poured out for [Em]us
The weight of every [C]curse upon Him


Interlude: 
[G   D   Em   C]


Verse 2: 
[G]One final breath He [D]gave
As Heaven looked [Em]away
The Son of God was [C]laid in darkness
[G]A battle in the [D]grave
The war on death was [Em]waged
The power of hell [C]forever broken


Pre-Chorus: 
T[G]he ground began to [D]shake
The stone was rolled [Em]away
His perfect love could [C]not be overcome
N[G/B]ow death where is your [D]sting
Our resurrected [Em]King 
Has rendered you [C]defeated
