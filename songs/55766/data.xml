Verse 1:
[F#m]Even when we were w[A]eak, despairing and [D]broken
You [F#m]did not give us to our hearts' des[D]ires

You [F#m]conquered death by g[A]iving up Your l[E]ife

Chorus:
Our [D]God [A]is a God [E]Who s[D]aves
Our [D]God [A]is a God [E]Who s[D]aves
Our [F#m]hearts are filled with w[E]onder
Our [A]mouths are filled with [Bm]praise
Our [D]God [A]is a G[E]od Who [(1x intro) (2x instrumental) (3x intro to end)]saves

Verse 2:
[F#m]If we've been reconc[A]iled{,} while we were still [D]rebels
