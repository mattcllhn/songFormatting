		<text>INTRO:    
[|  F#m      D  | F#m     D  |  F#m     D  |  E       D  |]

VERSE 1:
Not by [F#m]words and not by [D]deeds
But by [F#m]grace we have been [D]saved
And it [F#m]is the gift of [D]God, the faith we [Esus   D]need
Not by [F#m]strength and not by [D]might
But with [F#m]power from on [D]high
So that [F#m]we can only [D]boast, boast in [Esus   D]You

CHORUS:
[A]For once I w[D2]as dead, but now I’m a[Esus]live               
For [D2]freedom I’m set [A]free
And in your g[D2]reat love, I have f[Esus]ound      life
You [D]opened up my eyes  [A]

VERSE 2:
Not with [F#m]eloquence or [D]fame  
But in [F#m]weakness and in [D]shame
For the [F#m]power of your [D]strength, is then re[Esus   D]vealed
And the [F#m]message of Your [D]cross
Seems  like [F#m]foolishness to [D]some
But the [F#m]mercy of Your [D]grace is hidden [Esus   D]there

BRIDGE:
[F#m7]  What mercy,[E/G#] what mercy 
[A]  What mercy bene[D]ath the cross (2x)
[F#m7]   Your mercy,   [E/G#]    Your mercy 
[A]   Your mercy ben[D2]eath the cross (2x)
