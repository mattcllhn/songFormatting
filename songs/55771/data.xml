		<text>Verse 1:
The [A]gospel was promised{,} by sages and prophets
[D]   The Scriptures spoke of a [A]Son
Des[A]cendant of David{,} and yet uncreated
[D]   Clothed in our flesh He would [A]come
Pre[F#m]destined to [E]seek us, He [A]took on our weakness
[Bm]   And died our [F#m]death on the [D]cross
But [F#m]just as was [E]spoken, the [A]grave could not hold Him
[Bm]   The glorious [F#m]Son of [D]God

Chorus:
His name is [A]Jesus
His name is [E]Jesus
His name is [F#m]Jesus C[D]hrist, our L[A]ord [E]

Verse 2:
We're [A]loved and forgiven, compelled by a vision
[D]   To see His mercy pro[A]claimed
An[A]nouncing salvation{,} to every nation
[D]   All for the sake of His [A]name
We're [F#m]no longer [E]strangers, for [A]Jesus, our Savior
[Bm]   Has come to [F#m]make us His [D]own
We're [F#m]called to be [E]holy{,} and [A]now we live only
[Bm]   To make His [F#m]glory k[D]nown
