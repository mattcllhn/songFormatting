[G#m     | Bmaj7/F#     | Emaj7    (repeat)]

Verse 1:
[G#m7]Comfort for weary sinners, [Bmaj7/F#]strength for the struggling saint
[Emaj7]Jesus Christ has risen from the gr[B]ave [F#]
[G#m7]Peace when the waves are pounding, when [Bmaj7/F#]voices of hope sound faint
[Emaj7]Jesus Christ has risen from the gr[B]ave [F#]
How can [G#m]grief re[E]main{,} when our [C#m9]Savior [F#]reigns?

Chorus:
You are our [B]hope, You are our joy
You are our [G#m7]overcoming King
So we sing, “[Emaj7]Hallel[G#m7]ujah, [C#m]Jesus is al[F#]ive!”
Risen from [B]death, ascended on high
Glorious [G#m7]by the Father’s side
So we sing, “[Emaj7]Hallel[G#m7]ujah, [C#m]Jesus is al[F#]ive!”

Verse 2:
[G#m7]Power to fight temptation, the [Bmaj7/F#]world and the Devil’s lies
[Emaj7]Jesus Christ has risen from the gr[B]ave [F#]
[G#m7]Purpose in all our suffering, and [Bmaj7/F#]joy that will never die
[Emaj7]Jesus Christ has risen from the gr[B]ave [F#]
How can [G#m]grief re[E]main{,} when our [C#m9]Savior [F#]reigns?

Bridge:
[E2]Jesus,[B/D#]  victorious[C#m7]  in the [F#/A#]heavens exalted
[E2]Jesus,[B/D#]  give us[C#m7]  eyes to [F#/A#]see Your glory
[E2]Jesus,[B/D#]  victorious[C#m7]  in the [F#/A#]heavens exalted
[E2]Jesus,[B/D#]  give us[C#m7]  eyes to [F#/A#]see Your glory</text>
