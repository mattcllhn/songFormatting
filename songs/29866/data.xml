		<text>Verse 1: 
If my hands sins I got to lose it
I fight the flesh like I’m in a John Woo flick
Stay red-alert like it’s the bomb threat
Chosen by God election-John 10
We kill that sin to fuel our affections
So everyday is like a funeral procession
That’s called the sanctification process
In the local church that’s the context
We in a war Christian, furnish your sword
Die to the world-sever that cord
By God’s grace go earn them rewards
Show the city you would die even burn on a cross
Cause the world is watching ya’
Clocking every move on their speedometer
Eager to see where your eyes are fixed
Is it Christ or chicks- this is life or death

CHORUS: 
We put that sin to death
Till we aint got no strength left
We mortify the deeds of the flesh
Even if it takes our last breath

Verse 2: 
Any where on the 3rd rock, 3rd dimension
We neuter sin like it’s in the 3rd declension
Some wolves try to creep up in the flock
That’s when we like stop- herd inspection
The Word of God be the lamp for my feet
Keeps my life pointed in a certain direction
Rescue mission: God pulled me out the belly of the world 
like caesarean section
We know the reason the Son was crushed
That’s why we rather bleed than succumb to lust
Communion is sweet when you dutifully keep
Sins weeds from your heart like tares from wheat
But killing sin is the Spirits working
So look to the cross as He tears the curtain
Remove iniquity that’s why Christ was born
So you can die to the world- get your life transformed

Verse 3: 
The world is sick they need the great physician
They think their ancestors are apes and fishes
Can’t stand to see their own face in the mirror
So they buy implants and get their faces lifted
They got the whole thing twisted
God aint impressed with the major gifted
Nah, He takes a sinner then breaks addiction
Removes iniquity then makes him Christian
But not mint condition
Sanctification be the daily business
Teaching the Bible, making disciples,
Baptizing them- that’s the Great Commission
So we pray for wisdom
Lean on the Word when we make decisions
One God, one faith it aint Islam
Mohammed’s still dead- Christ is risen

CHORUS x2
