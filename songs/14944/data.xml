[Dm     | Bb   C   | Dm      | Bb   C   |]

Verse 1:
I [Dm]saw one hanging on a tree,{,} in [Bb]agony and [C]blood
Who [Dm]fixed His loving eyes on me, as [Gm7]near His cross I [Am7]stood
And [Gsus]never till my [G]dying breath, will [Bb]I forget that [Am]look
It [Dm]seemed to [C]charge me [Bb2]with His death, 
Though [Am7]not a word He [G]spoke [| Bb    C    |]

Verse 2:
My [Dm]conscience felt and owned the guilt{,} and [Bb]plunged me in des[C]pair
I [Dm]saw my sins His blood had spilt, and [Gm7]helped to nail Him [Am7]there
But [Gsus]with a second [G]look He said, “I [Bb]freely all for[Am]give
This [Dm]blood is [C]for your [Bb2]ransom paid
I [Am7]died that you might [G]live” [| Bb    C    |]

Chorus:
For[F]ever [Bb]etched upon my [Gm]mind, is the [Dm]look of [C]Him who [Bb]died
The [F/A]Lamb I cruci[Gm]fied  [Csus   C]
And [F]now my [Bb]life will sing the [Gm]praise, of [Dm]pure a[C]toning [Bb]grace
That [F/A]looked on me{,} and [Gm7]gladly [Am7]took my [Bb   | Am   | Bb   | Am7   |]place

Verse 3:
Thus [Dm]while His death my sin displays, for [Bb]all the world to [C]view
Such [Dm]is the mystery of grace, it [Gm7]seals my pardon [Am7]too
With [Gsus]pleasing grief and [G]mournful joy, my [Bb]spirit now is [Am]filled
That [Dm]I should [C]such a [Bb2]life destroy
Yet [Am7]live by Him I [G]killed [| Bb    C    |]</text>
