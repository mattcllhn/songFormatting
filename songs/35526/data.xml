		<text>Verse 1: 
[E]    You are so good to me
I did not know you but I
[B]   Heard you call out my name
I couldn’t see you but I
[E]   Felt you reach into my heart
Take all my fear and shame
[B]   Pour all your kindness in
You turned my life around

Pre-Chorus 1:
And[C#M7] now You have o[E]pened up my [C#M7]eyes
To the m[E]ystery of Your g[F#M7]race  [A] 

Chorus: 
I could sing, I could [E]dance in the st[A]reet
I could sh[B]out from the r[A]oof
How Your l[E]ove set me f[A]ree
How this G[B]ospel is t[A]rue
You’re the w[E]ay, You’re the t[A]ruth, You’re the l[B]ife
And I will a[A]lways follow [F#M7]You   
You make all things [A]new
Jesus You are [E]good.  [A]     [E]   [A]     [B]   [A]     [B]   [A]

Verse 2: 
[E]   You are like no-one else
You reign forever Jesus
[B]   Name above every name
Today, forever you’re the same
[E]   You conquered sin for me
Your blood has made me clean
[B]   Your mercy covers me
Your goodness leads me on

Pre-Chorus 2: 
And [C#M7]now I can n[E]ever be the s[C#M7]ame
You a[E]lone deserve my p[F#M7]raise   [A] 

Chorus: 
I could sing, I could [E]dance in the st[A]reet
I could sh[B]out from the r[A]oof
How Your l[E]ove set me f[A]ree
How this G[B]ospel is t[A]rue
You’re the w[E]ay, You’re the t[A]ruth, You’re the l[B]ife
And I will a[A]lways follow [F#M7]You   
You make all things [A]new
Jesus You are [E]good.  [A]     [E]   [A]     [B]   [A]     [B]   [A] 

Bridge: 
[F#M7]    There is o[A]nly one way,
[F#M7]   There is o[A]nly one name,
[F#M7]   There is o[A]nly one God,
[F#M7]   Jesus Y[A]ou, and You alone can s[E]ave. [A]     [E][A]     [B]   I could sing...
