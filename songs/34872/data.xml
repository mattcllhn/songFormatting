		<text>VERSE 1:
A[C#M]mazing g[A]race, how s[E]weet the s[B]ound  
That s[C#M]aved a w[A]retch like m[E]e [B]
I o[C#M]nce was l[A]ost, but n[E]ow I’m f[B]ound
T’was b[C#M]lind, but n[A]ow I s[E]ee so cl[B]early 

VERSE 2:
Was g[C#M]race that t[A]aught my h[E]eart to f[B]ear  
And g[C#M]race my f[A]ears reli[E]eved  [B]
How p[C#M]recious d[A]id that g[E]race app[B]ear
The h[C#M]our I f[A]irst beli[E]eved  [B]

CHORUS:
[C#M]   Hallelu[A]jah, grace like r[E]ain falls d[B]own on me
[C#M]   Hallelu[A]jah, all my st[E]ains are washed aw[B]ay
Their washed away [C#M]   [A]    [E]    [B]

VERSE 3:
When w[C#M]e’ve been th[A]ere ten th[E]ousand y[B]ears
Bright sh[C#M]ining a[A]s the s[E]un  [B]
We’ve n[C#M]o less d[A]ays to s[E]ing God’s pr[B]aise
Than w[C#M]hen we f[A]irst beg[E]un  [B]
