[||: C     | C     | Em     | G     :||]
Verse 1:
[C]We have come today to worship
[Em]We have come to praise the One
[Am]Who came down into our darkness
[F]Born a lowly [G]virgin’s son
[C]You who did not come with splendor
[Em]Pomp and strength and majesty
[Am]You who came to us in weakness
[F]Born to us in [G]poverty

Chorus:
Em[G]ma[C]nu[F]el, [G] [ ]Emma[C]nu[F]el, [G] [ ]Emma[C]nu[Fmaj7]el
In [Em]You alone we [F]hope and trust
[Em]Jesus, Savior, [F]God with us, [F2] [ ]Emmanu[C    | C    | Em    | G    |]el

{new_page}
Verse 2:
[C]We were blind and lost and godless
[Em]Wandering a trackless waste
[Am]Then hope arose, a glorious beacon
[F]Like the star the [G]wise men chased
[C]Down from heaven came a Savior
[Em]Born a child, so small and frail
[Am]Taking up our pain and troubles
[F]Conquering where [G]we had failed

Verse 3:
[C]You who with a word created
[Em]Sun and moon and seas and sand
[Am]Lay there sleeping in a manger
[F]Cradled by Your [G]mother’s hand
[C]You who made the mighty forests
[Em]Would lie down upon a tree
[Am]Fastened there with nails for sinners
Would [F]bleed and die to [G]set us free</text>
