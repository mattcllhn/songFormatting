INTRO:
[||: F     | G6    | Am    | C2/E    :||]


VERSE 1:
Del[Dm]iver us from evil, [Am]Lord; we [F]sojourn in a broken [G]world
Though [Dm]evil hands give rise to [Am]war, re[F]mind us this is not our [G]home
We [F]look to You, we [Am]look to You, [C]sovereign King of all the [F]earth 
We [F]look to You, we [Am]look to You; [C]in Your strength we will e[F]ndure
[C]In Your strength we will en[F]dure [| F]


VERSE 2:
Del[Dm]iver us from evil, [Am]Lord; our [F]hearts so quickly run as[G]tray
Temp[Dm]tation crouching at the [Am]door to [F]turn us from the narrow [G]way 
We [F]look to You, we [Am]look to You, [C]Christ, the conquering Son of [F]God 
We [F]look to You, we [Am]look to You; [C]Lord, complete what You’ve[F] begun
[C]Lord, complete what You’ve be[F]gun [| G6 | Am | C2/E | F | G6 | Am | C/E]


VERSE 3:
[F]Deliver us from evil, [G6]Lord; the [Am7]devil’s seeking to de[C2/E]vour
With [F]trembling hearts we hear his [G6]roar
But [Am7]Your strong arm will crush his [C2/E]pow’r
We [F]look to You, we [Am]look to You; [C]come and end his earthly [F]reign 
We [F]look to You, we [Am]look to You; [C]Lord, deliver us we [F]pray 
We [F]look to You, we [Am]look to You; [C]You will come again to [F]reign 
We [F]look to You, we [Am]look to You; [C]All the earth will bow in [F]praise
