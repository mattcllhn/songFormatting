[G   D   Em   G     | Em   C   D   G  (repeat)]

V. 1: 
Im[G]mova[D]ble our [Em]hope re[G]mains{,} though [Em]shifting sands be[D]fore us [G]lie
The [G]One who [D]washed a[Em]way our [G]stains{,} shall [Em]bear us safely [D]to the [G]skies
The [D]floods may rise, the [Am]winds may [Em]beat{,} torrential rains des[C]cend [G] 
Yet [D]God His own will [Am]not for[Em]get. He’ll [C]love and keep us till the [Bm]end
You’ll [C]love and [Em]keep us [D]till the [(intro)]end

V. 2: 
This [G]is e[D]ternal [Em]life:{,} to [G]know the [Em]living God{,} and [D]Christ, the [G]Son
The [G]Savior [D]will not [Em]let us [G]go{,} un[Em]til His saving [D]work is [G]done
Our [D]debt was great, as [Am]was our [Em]need,{,} but now the price is [C]paid [G] 
Who [D]can behold Im[Am]manuel [Em]bleed{,} and [C]doubt His willingness to [Bm]save?
We [C]trust Your [Em]willing[D]ness to [(intro)]save

V. 3: 
The [G]Lord ac[D]quits, who [Em]can con[G]demn?{,} Though [Em]Satan’s accu[D]sations [G]fly
His [G]pow’r can [D]never [Em]reach our [G]names{,} to [Em]blot them from the [D]Book of [G]Life
The [D]Son has surely [Am]made us [Em]free.{,} His Word forever [C]stands [G] 
And [D]all our joy is [Am]knowing [Em]we{,} are [C]graven on His wounded [Bm]hands
We’re [C]graven [Em]on Your [D]wounded [3/4 G]hands

Inst: 
[3/4 G     | 5/4 D/G    Em  C  | 3/4 G     | G     | 5/4 D/G    Em  D  | 6/4 C    D    ]

{key:A}
V. 4: 
Built [A]into [E]Christ, se[F#m]cure we [A]stand,{,} for [F#m]with His Spirit [E]we’ve been [A]sealed
By [A]grace we’ll [E]see the [F#m]promised [A]land, where [F#m]every sorrow [E]shall be [D]healed
To [E]God who gave His [Bm]only [F#m]Son, to Jesus Christ, our [D]Lord [A] 
To [E]God the Spirit, [Bm]Three in [F#m]one, be [D]songs of praise forever[C#m]more
We’ll [D]sing Your [Bm]praise for[E]ever[3/4 A]more

End:
