[Asus   A   | Asus   A   | Esus   E   | Esus   E]

Verse 1:
[Asus]I drink [A]deep from Your [Asus]well of [A]grace
And it’s [Esus]sweet, [E]so sweet to my s[Esus   E]oul
For [Asus]none can [A]quench this [Asus]thirsting
[A]Of my h[Esus]eart but [E]You al[Esus   E]one
Be[Bm]cause You have made me to kn[D]ow
And enjoy You for[Bm]ever, I cry to Y[G]ou

Chorus:
Lord I must have [Asus]You, [A]Your goodness, Your tr[Asus   A]uth
I am con[Esus]sumed [E]with passion for Y[D]ou
The One who has s[Asus]aved me [A]
The One who sust[Asus]ains me, [A]I’m desperate it’s true
[Esus ] [E]Lord, I must have Y[D]ou.

Verse 2:
[Asus]I’m pos[A]sessed with a [Asus]hunger
[A]To beh[Esus]old [E]Your majes[Esus   E]ty
And [Asus]I’m ob[A]sessed with the [Asus]wonder
[A]That You, my G[Esus]od, would [E]die for m[Esus   E]e
Be[Bm]cause of the cross I will pr[D]aise
I will love You for[Bm]ever, so I cry to Y[G]ou
