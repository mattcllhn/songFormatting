		<text>Intro:
[Am      | F     | C      | G]

VERSE 1:
There’s [Am]nothing that my [F]hands can do{,} to [C]save my guilty [G]soul
I [Am]cannot cleanse my [F]filthy stains{,} or [C]make my spirit [G]whole
For [Am]nothing but the [F]blood of Christ{,} can [C]all my sins e[G]rase
I [Am]dare not claim my [F]righteousness{,} but [Dm]hide with[G]in His [C]grace
‘Tis [Am]Christ who saved me [F]from the depths, God’s [C/E]pardon I’ve re[G]ceived
I’m [Am]washed within His [F]precious blood, my [Dm]heart is sprinkled [(intro)]clean

VERSE 2:
I’ll [Am]praise the God of [F]holiness, of [C]justice, truth, and [G]might
Who [Am]guides me by His [F]mighty hand{,} to [C]walk within His [G]light
While [Am]Satan weaves his [F]shallow lies{,} God [C]speaks to me in [G]love
Re[Am]minding me His [F]only Son{,} has [Dm]bought me [G]with His [C]blood
And [Am]Christ dispels my [F]every doubt, through [C/E]Him I am re[G]deemed
I [Am]love because He [F]loved me first, I [Dm]live because He [(intro)]lives

{key:Bm}
VERSE 3:
My [Bm]life is but a [G]fleeting sigh, a [D]tear within the [A]sea
But [Bm]You are ever[G]lasting, Lord,{,} and [D]You’ve predestined [A]me
To [Bm]leave this fading [G]world behind, not [D]fearing death will [A]come
For [Bm]then I’ll look on [G]Jesus Christ{,} and [Em]to His [A]arms I’ll [D]run
And [Bm]when I see Him [G]face to face, what [D/F#]glory that will [A]be
To [Bm]look upon my [G]Savior’s scars{,} and [Em]know they [A]were for [D | G | Bm | D]me</text>
