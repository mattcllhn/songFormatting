		<text>Verse 1: 
[A]Absent from [Aadd7]flesh, O b[C]lissful th[D]ought
What [G]joy this [D]moment br[A]ings
[A]Freed from the [Aadd7]blame my [C]sin has br[D]ought,
From [G]pain and d[D]eath and its st[A]ing.  [Aadd7] 

Verse 2: 
[A]Absent from [Aadd7]flesh, O Gl[C]orious d[D]ay!
In [G]one tri[D]umphant str[A]oke
My [A]reckoning [Aadd7]paid, my ch[C]arges dr[D]opped
and the [G]bonds 'round my [D]hands are [A]broke. [Aadd7] 

CHORUS: 
I [G]go where [D]God and g[A]lory shine,
To [G]one et[D]ernal [A]day
This f[G]ailing b[D]ody I [A]now resign,
For the [G]angels p[D]oint my [A]way.
For the [G]angels p[D]oint my [A]way.

Verse 3: 
[A]Absent from [Aadd7]flesh! then [C]rise, my s[D]oul,
Where [G]feet nor w[D]ings could [A]climb,
Bey[A]ond the [Aadd7]sky, where p[C]lanets r[D]oll,
And be[G]yond all [D]keep of [A]time.  [Aadd7] </text>
