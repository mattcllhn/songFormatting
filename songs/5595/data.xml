		<text>Verse 1:
God [D]moves in a my[A]sterious [G/B]way
His [A]wonders [G/B]to per[D]form
He [D]plants His [Bm]footsteps [A]in the [D]sea
And [A]rides up[Em]on the [D]storm

Verse 2:
Ye [D]fearful saints fresh [A]courage [G/B]take
The [A]clouds ye [G/B]so much [D]dread
Are [D]big with [Bm]mercy, [A]and shall [D]break
In [A]blessings [Em]on your [D]head

Verse 3:
Judge [D]not the Lord by [A]feeble [G/B]sense     
But [A]trust Him [G/B]for His [D]grace
Be[D]hind a [Bm]frowning [A]provi[D]dence
He [A]hides a [Em]smiling [D]face

Verse 4:
His [D]purposes will [A]ripen [G/B]fast                
Un[A]folding [G/B]every [D]hour   
The [D]bud may [Bm]have a [A]bitter [D]taste
But [A]sweet will [Em]be the [D]flower

Verse 5:
Blind [D]unbelief is [A]sure to [G/B]err
And [A]scan His [G/B]work in [D]vain
God [D]is His [Bm]own in[A]terpre[D]ter
And [A]He will [Em]make it [D]plain</text>
