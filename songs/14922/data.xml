		<text>Intro:
[C#m    B    | A      | C#m    B    | A]

Verse 1:
Lord, what moved Your [C#m]heart{,} to love lowly [A]man
Before any [E]star could herald Your [B]praise
And why did You [C#m]come abasing Your[A]self
Veiled in a [E]robe of frail human [B]clay?
Why [F#m]would You, the pure{,} give Your [A]life for the vile
The [F#m]innocent seeking the [A]guilty{,} to be recon[D]ciled[A]

Chorus:
I [B]can’t compre[E]hend{,} this [B]fathomless [D]love
I’m [A]gripped and a[E]mazed{,} at [B]what You have [D]done
Why [A]would the [F#m]Adored{,} become the des[D]pised
To bear all the [F#m]furious [A]wrath{,} that was [Bsus    | B]mine?
How [E]awesome this [B]myste[D]ry [A]
Of Your [F#m]fathomless love [Bsus  B] [ ]for [C#m (intro)]me.

Verse 2:
Why would You a[C#m]dopt{,} and take as Your [A]own
Those who had [E]crushed{,} Your one precious [B]Son
Why mercy and [C#m]grace{,} towards Your ene[A]mies
Your name they have [E]cursed{,} and Your throne they have [B]shunned
O [F#m]how could You choose{,} to show [A]kindness to these
The [F#m]ones who would mock You{,} and [A]hate You,
The ones just like [D]me? [A]</text>
