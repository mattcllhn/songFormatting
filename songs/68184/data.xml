		<text>V1:
O Lamb of [Ab]God, all worlds o[Db]beyed Your [Ab]will
From dark and[Db] void their being[Eb] came
O Lamb of [Ab]God, Your glories [Db]echo[Ab] still
Creation[Db] sings its [Fm]Maker’s[Eb] praise
Eternal [Fm]God, One with the [Db]Fa[Ab/C]ther, before all [Eb]time You dwelt in[Db] love
E[Eb]ternal [Fm]God, unlike all [Db]o[Ab/C]thers, yet You de[Db]scen[Ab/C]ded  [Eb]unto [Ab]us [| Ab]

V2:
O Lamb of [Ab]God, in filthy [Db]manger[Ab] lay
In humbl[Db]e dress You entered[Eb] earth
O Lamb of [Ab]God, Creator [Db]bows to[Ab] save
The needy[Db] ones, help[Fm]less fro[Eb]m birth
Incarnat[Fm]e Word, gift of the [Db]Fa[Ab/C]ther to take our [Eb]place and [Fm]bear ou[Db]r sin
In[Eb]carnate[Fm] Word led to the [Db]slaugh[Ab/C]ter,
You conquered [Db]death [Ab/C]and  [Eb]rose a[Ab]gain [| Ab6    | Ab    | Ab6]

V3:
O Lamb of [Ab]God now reigning [Db]on the [Ab]throne
The Judge of[Db] all, faith[Fm]ful and[Eb] true
O Lamb of [Ab]God, You’ll make Your [Db]power[Ab] known
When all You[Db]r foes re[Fm]ceive thei[Eb]r due
Victorious [Fm]King, when history’s [Db]fa[Ab/C]ding
You’ll call Your [Eb]Bride to [Fm]take her[Db] place
Vic[Eb]torious [Fm]King, Creation’s [Db]wai[Ab/C]ting
For Your re[Db]deemed [Ab/C]to [Eb]see Your[Fm] face
For Your re[Bbm]deemed [Ab/C]to [Eb]see Your[Ab] face [| Ab6    | Ab    | Ab6    | Ab]</text>
