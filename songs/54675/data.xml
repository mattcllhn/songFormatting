 O[A7sus] Church, ari[D]se and put your [G/B]armor [A/C#]on 
 Hear the [D/F#]call of [G]Christ,our [Asus]Ca[A]p - [D]tain 
 For n[A7sus]ow the [D]weak can say that [G/B]they are [A/C#]strong
 In the [D/F#]strength that [G]God has [Asus]gi [A]- [D]ven 
 With [D/F#]shield of [G]faith and [D/F#]belt of [A]truth
 We’ll [D/F#]stand a[G]gainst the [D/F#]de - [Bm]vil’s [A]lies
 An [A7sus]army [D]bold whose battle [G/B]cry is [A/C#]love
 Reaching [D/F#]out to [G]those in [Asus]da - [A]rk - [D]ness   [Dsus    D] 

Verse 2: 
 Our [A7sus]call to [D]war to love the [G/B]captive [A/C#]soul 
 But to [D/F#]rage a[G]gainst the [Asus]ca - [A]p - [D]tor
 And [A7sus]with the [D]sword that makes the [G/B]wounded [A/C#]whole
 We will [D/F#]fight with [G]faith and [Asus]v - [A]a - [D]lor
 When [D/F#]faced with [G]trials on [D/F#]every [A]side 
 We [D/F#]know the [G]outcome [D/F#]is [Bm]se[A]cure
 And [A7sus]Christ will [D]have the prize for [G/B]which He [A/C#]died
 And in[D/F#]heri[G]tance of [Asus]n - [A]a - [D]tions [Dsus  D]

Verse 3: 
 Come [A7sus]see the [D]cross where love and [G/B]mercy [A/C#]meet
 As the [D/F#]Son of [G]God is [Asus]str - [A]ick - [D]en
 Then [A7sus]see His [D]foes lie crushed be[G/B]neath His [A/C#]feet 
 For the [D/F#]Conquer  -  [G]or has [Asus]r - [A]i - [D]sen 
 And [D/F#]as the [G]stone is [D/F#]rolled a[A]way
 And [D/F#]Christ e[G]merges [D/F#]from [Bm]the [A]grave 
 This [A7sus]victory [D]march continues [G/B]till the [A/C#]day
 Every [D/F#]eye and [G]heart shall [Asus]se - [A]e - [D]Him [Dsus  D] 

Verse 4: 
 So [A7sus]Spirit, [D]come put strength in [G/B]every [A/C#]stride
 Give [D/F#]grace for [G]every [Asus]hu - [A]r - [D]dle
 That [A7sus]we may [D]run with faith to [G/B]win the [A/C#]prize
 Of a [D/F#]servant [G]good and [Asus]fai - [A]th - [D]ful
 As [D/F#]saints of [G]old still [D/F#]line the [A]way
 Re[D/F#]telling [G]triumphs [D/F#]of - [Bm]His [A]grace
 We [A7sus]hear their [D]calls and hunger [G/B]for the [A/C#]day
 When with [D/F#]Christ we [G]stand in [Asus]gl - [A]o - [D]ry [Dsus   D]
