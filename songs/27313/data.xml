[D     | G    D    | Bm    A    | D]

Verse 1:
[D]Mystery of mysteries, that [G]God would make for [D]me
A [Bm]place within His family, though [A]once His enemy
The [D]Judge of every sinner{,} sent [G]Christ to Calva[D]ry
To pre[Bm]pare a [A]place for [D    | D]me

Verse 2:
[D]Judgment should be given{,} for this [G]guilt upon my [D]head
But the [Bm]Father of all glory{,} [A]crushed His Son instead
[D]Now I’ve been adopted,{,} for [G]God made this to [D]be
You pre[Bm]pared a [A]place for [D]me

Chorus:
[G]Bles[D]sed [A]be,[D] [G]bles[D]sed [A]be [D]
My [Em]God [D]and Sa[A/C#]vior,{,} You’ve [D]shown [A]me fa[G]vor
And pre[Em7]pared a [Asus]place for [D    | G/D   D   | Bm   A   | D]me

Verse 3:
[D]Father, in the moment
When Your [G]Son shall split the [D]skies
And [Bm]myriads of angels{,} ac[A]claim Him with their cries
By [D]grace I will be able to [G]join the jubi[D]lee
You pre[Bm]pared a [A]place for [D]me</text>
