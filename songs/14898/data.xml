Verse 2:
Though trials [C2]come and every [F2]one
Can take me [Csus C]further [Am7]from Your [Gsus]truth [F2]

Bridge:
In [Am7]You there's no shadow of turning
[G6]Constant in all Your ways
You're [Fmaj7]growing my faith{,} and I'm [Gsus]learning to lean 
On [F/A]You all of my [Gsus]days   [G]</text>
