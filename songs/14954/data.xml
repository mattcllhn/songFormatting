		<text>Verse 1:
Rock of [C]Ages, [G]cleft for [C]me, let me [Em]hide my[F]self in [G]Thee
Let the [Am]water [G]and the [F]blood, from Thy [Em]wounded side which [F]flowed
Be of [Em]sin the double [F]cure,
Save from [Dm9]wrath and [Gsus]make me [C]pure

Verse 2:
All the [C]labors [Csus]of my [C]hands, could not [Em]meet Thy [F]law’s de[G]mands
Could my [Am]zeal no [G]respite [F]know, could my [Em]tears forever [F]flow
All for [Em]sin could not a[F]tone,
Thou must [Dm9]save, and [Gsus]Thou a[Fmaj7/A   | G7/B   | Fmaj9/A   | G7/B]lone

Verse 3:
Nothing [Am]in my hand I [G/A]bring, simply [Dm/A]to the cross I [Am2]cling
Naked [Dm]come to [G]Thee for [F]dress, helpless [Em]look to Thee for [F]grace
To Thy [Em]fountain, Lord, I [F]fly
Wash me [Dm9]Savior, [Gsus]or I [Ab (to bridge)]die

Bridge:

Verse 4:
While I [C/G]draw this [G]fleeting [C/G]breath,
When mine [Em/G]eyes shall [F/G]close in [G]death
When I [Am]soar to [G]worlds un[F]known,
See Thee [Cmaj7/G]on Thy judgment [Fmaj7/G]throne, 
Rock of [Cmaj7/G]Ages, cleft for [Fmaj7]me,
Let me [Dm9]hide my[| Dm9    | Dm9    | Dm9]self
In [C2]Thee</text>
