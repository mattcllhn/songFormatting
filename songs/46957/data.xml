		<text>INTRO:
[G     | C     | Em    | D]

VERSE 1:
The [C]radiance of the F[G]ather{,} be[C]fore the dawn of [G]time
You [Em]spoke and all cre[C]ation came to [G     D]be
The [C]molecules and pl[G]anets{,} re[C]veal Your great de[G]sign
And [Em]every one was m[D]ade so we could [Am]see, so [Em]we could [C]see

CHORUS:
You are the gl[G]orious Christ, the greatest of [C/E]all delights
Your power is un[C]equaled, Your love beyond all [D]heights
No greater s[G]acrifice{,} than when You laid [C/E]down Your life
We join the song of [C]angels{,} who praise You day and [D]night
Glorious [G]Christ [| C     | Em     | D]

VERSE 2:
You [C]left the air of h[G]eaven{,} to [C]breathe the dust of [G]earth
And [Em]dwell among the [C]outcast and the [G]poor [| D]
You [C]came to be fors[G]aken{,} and [C]died to take our [G]curse
So [Em]You could be our [D]joy forever[Am]more, for[Em]everm[C]ore

BRIDGE:
[Em7] [ ]You’re sea[D]ted now in heaven[G/B],    enthroned [C]at God’s right hand
[Em7] [ ]You’ve shat[D]tered death and freed us{,} [G/B]from our [C]fears  
[Em7] [ ]And though [D]we cannot see You,[G/B]     You’re com[C]ing back again
[Am7] [ ]And all will be made r[G/B]ight{,} when You app[C]ear    [G/B]
[Am7] [ ]And all will be made r[G/B]ight{,} when You app[Dsus]ear    [ | D]</text>
