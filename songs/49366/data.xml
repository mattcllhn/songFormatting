My [G]Lord, how l[D]ong, my L[C]ord, how l[G]ong
Must [C]I this [C/D]trial end[G]ure?
I [C]am so weak, so n[G]eedy, God
My s[Am7]oul and mind im[D]pure.

Chorus 1: 
For[C]give me Lord, I p[G]ray.
 I h[C]ave not sought your f[G]ace
I [C]long for p[D]eace
Oh [Em]make me [G/D]see
That [C]You are [C/D]all I n[G]eed.

Verse 2: 
I [G]wait on [D]you, I [C]wait on [G]you,
Un[C]til you [C/D]show the [G]way.
Be [C]faithful to your [G]holy word,
Pour [Am7]out your sovereign [D]grace.

Lift [G]up my [D]eyes, Lift [C]up my [G]eyes,

For[C]give me Lord, I p[G]ray.
Oh, [C]help me seek your [G]face
