		<text>Verse 1:
Our [A]mouths were open graves, full of [F#m7]broken vows we [D]made
Our [B]hearts ran wild, our tongues could not be [E]tamed

What [A]darkness had concealed{,} Your [F#m7]law has now re[D]vealed
Our [B]guilt was great, our bitter fate was [E]sealed

Chorus 1:
Our [F#m]only hope, our [D/F#]only hope is [A]You, [E/G#]Lord
Our [F#m]only hope, our [D/F#]only hope is [A]You

Verse 3:
Though [A]hypocrites and fools, You [F#m7]draw us to the [D]truth
For [B]Your own glory{,} You make all things [E]new

Chorus 2:
Our [F#m]only hope, our [D/F#]only hope is [A]You, [E/G#]Lord
Our [F#m]only hope, our [D/F#]only hope is [A]You, [E]Lord

Bridge:
The [A/C#]bridges we had burned{,} You have rest[D]ored
You [F#m]gave us hope{,} when there was none bef[E]ore
You [A/C#]paid the debt that we could not aff[D]ord
And [F#m]cast away our guilt foreverm[E]ore

Verse 4:
So, [A]when our days are through our [F#m7]hope will rest in [D]You
For [B]we can trust Your promises are [E]true
