Verse 1:
It was [C2]love that brought You [G]from above
To [C2]walk upon the [G]earth
And [C2]love that caused Your [G]weariness
Your [Em]hunger and Your [D]thirst
It was [C2]love that caused You [G]to be tried
And [C2]tempted by the [G]foe
And [C2]love that brought the [G]nails and cross
And [Em]love that bought my [D]soul

Chorus:
How wonderful Your [C2]love, the mystery of [Em7]mysteries
Filling up my [C2]heart,{,} more glorious than I[D] [ ]know
How wonderful Your [C2]love, there’s nothing else so[Em7] sweet to me
I’ll never be a[C2]part,{,} from the [G/B]Lover of my [D]soul
From the Lover [Dsus4]of [D]my [C2]soul[| G   D   | C2     | C2]

Verse 2:
Your [C2]love is filled with [G]holiness
O [C2]Spirit, fan this [G]flame
Your [C2]love will never [G]cease or cool
Your [Em]love will never [D]change
O [C2]let me see Your [G]love for me
A[C2]round me every[G]where
The [C2]shining sun, a [G]gentle rain
Re[Em]mind me of Your [D]care</text>
