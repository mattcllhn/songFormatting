I[B7/D#]saiah told us [Esus]long a[E]go{,} a[G#7]bout this rose we’d [C#m]find [A]
In [E]virgin [G#m]arms, we [A]shall be[E]hold{,} the [A6]Savior [Bsus]of mankind [E (intro)]

VERSE 2:
The [C#m]glories [G#m]of the [A]hea[E]vens{,} sur[F#m]rounded shep[E/G#]herds [A]bright
The [C#m]angels [G#m]sang, a [A]sign was [E]shown, the [F#m]Christ was [F#7]born that [B]night
What [B7/D#]mystery they [Esus]came u[E]pon, the [G#7]sign the heralds [C#m]laud [A]
