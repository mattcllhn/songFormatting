[Eb   | Gm    | Bb/F    | Dm    | Eb    | Gm    | Bb/F   | Dm]

V. 1:
My [Cm]Redeemer’s love is [Bb]deeper[F]{,} [ ]than the depths of sin and [Gm]hell
He who was enthroned in [Eb]glory[Gm]{,} [ ]came to bring us to Hims[F]elf
My Redeemer’s love is [Eb]wider[Gm]{,} [ ]than the breach my sins had [Cm]made
[Eb] [ ]He reached down into my [Gm]darkness[F]{,} [ ]He alone has pow’r[Bb] to save

CH. 1:
[Eb]Deeper than the rolling s[Bb]eas, [Gm]higher than the mountain p[F]eaks
Your l[Eb]ove is [Gm]all I n[F]eed

V. 2:
My Redeemer’s love is [Bb]stronger[F]{,} [ ]than my fiercest ene[Gm]mies
He will hold me in the [Eb]tempest[Gm], [ ]through the flood He carries [F]me
My Redeemer’s love will [Eb]lead me[Gm]{,} [ ]through the deepest valley [Cm]here
[Eb] [ ]He will shepherd me and [Gm]guide me[F], [ ]He will ever kee[Bb]p me near

CH. 2:
[Eb]Deeper than the rolling s[Bb]eas, [Gm]higher than the mountain p[F]eaks
Your l[Eb]ove is [Gm]all I n[F]eed
[Eb]Stronger than the rushing w[Bb]ind, [Gm]shattering the power of s[F]in
Your l[Eb]ove is [Gm]all I n[F]eed

V. 3:
My Redeemer’s love grows [Bb]sweeter[F]{,} [ ]as eternity draws [Gm]near
I’ll enjoy His love for[Eb]ever[Gm]{,} [ ]at His throne for endless [F]years
My Redeemer’s love will [Eb]fill me[Gm]{,} [ ]on the day I see His [Cm]face
[Eb] [ ]I will love Him back for[Gm]ever[F]{,} [ ]and forever sin[Bb]g His praise</text>
