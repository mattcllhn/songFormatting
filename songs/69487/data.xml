		<text> The LORD is my light and my salvation;
  whom shall I fear?
 The LORD is the stronghold of my life;
  of whom shall I be afraid?
 
 When evildoers assail me
  to eat up my flesh,
 my adversaries and foes,
  it is they who stumble and fall.
 
 Though an army encamp against me,
  my heart shall not fear;
 though war arise against me,
  yet I will be confident.
 
 One thing have I asked of the LORD,
  that will I seek after :
 that I may dwell in the house of the LORD
  all the days of my life,
 to gaze upon the beauty of the LORD
  and to inquire in his temple.
 
 For he will hide me in his shelter
  in the day of trouble;
 he will conceal me under the cover of his tent;
  he will lift me high upon a rock.
 
 And now my head shall be lifted up
  above my enemies all around me,
 and I will offer in his tent
  sacrifices with shouts of joy;
 I will sing and make melody to the LORD.
