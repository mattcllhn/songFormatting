[D]Come Thou [D]Fount of every [A]blessing,
Tune my [G]heart to [A]sing Thy [D]Grace

Call for [G]songs of [A]loudest [D]praise
Teach me [Bm]some melodious sonnet,
Sung by [Bm]flaming [A]tongues a[G]bove
Praise the [D]mount! I'm fixed u[A]pon it,
Mount of [G]Thy re[A]deeming [D]love [2x Run]

VERSE 2: 
[A]Hither[D]to Thy love has [A]blest me,

Safely [G]home by [A]Thy good [D]grace
Jesus [Bm]sought me when a stranger,
Wandering [Bm]from the [A]fold of [G]God

How I'll [G]sing Thy [A]sovereign [D]grace;
[A]Come, my [Bm]Lord, no longer tarry,
Take my [Bm]ransomed [A]soul a[G]way;
Send Thine [D]angels now to [A]carry
Me to [G]realms of [A]endless [D]day [4x Run]
