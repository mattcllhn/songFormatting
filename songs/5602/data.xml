		<text>Verse 1:
To [F]God be the glory, great [C]things He hath [F]done,
So [Bb]loved He the [F]world, that He [G]gave us His [C]son,
Who [F]yielded His life, an a[C]tonement for [F]sin,
And [Bb]opened the [F]life-gate, that [C]all may come [F]in.

Chorus:
Praise the [F]Lord, praise the Lord, let the earth hear His [C]voice,
Praise the [C]Lord, praise the Lord, let the people re[F]joice!
O [F]come to the Father, through [C]Jesus the [F]Son,
And [Bb]give Him the [F]glory, great [C]things He hath [F]done.

Verse 2:
O [F]perfect redemption, the [C]purchase of [F]blood!
To [Bb]every be[F]liever the [G]promise of [C]God;
The [F]vilest offender who [C]truly be[F]lieves,
That [Bb]moment from [F]Jesus a [C]pardon re[F]ceives.

Verse 3:
Great [F]things He hath taught us, great [C]things He hath [F]done,
And [Bb]great our re[F]joicing, through [G]Jesus the [C]Son,
But [F]purer and higher and [C]greater will [F]be
Our [Bb]wonder, our [F]transport, when [C]Jesus we [F]see.
