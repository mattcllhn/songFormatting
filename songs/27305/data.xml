		<text>Intro: 
[||: G      | G      | C2      | C2      :||]

Verse 1: 
[G] [ ]How has the sinner been for[Em7]given
How has the [C2]rebel been made clean
Or blinded [Am]eyes been made to see
[G] [ ]How have the orphans been a[Em7]dopted
Who hated Your [C2]love and ran from grace
Despised and re[Am]jected all Your ways

Chorus: 
How wonderful the [G]Father’s love
The Father’s love for [C2]us
That He would send His [Em7]only Son
To come and rescue [C2]us
He has [Am]saved us, called us blameless
Guides us [Em7]now and will sustain [D]us
Oh how [C2]wonderful the [Dsus]Father’s [G    | G    | C2    | C2]love

Verse 2: 
[G] [ ]Your mercy floods our lives with [Em7]kindness
Your grace has [C2]colored all we see
And You have [Am]promised not to leave
[G] [ ]You freely give Your Spirit [Em7]to us
So we can be [C2]sure we’re sons of God
And rest in the [Am]hope of what’s to come
