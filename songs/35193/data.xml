[D]Come and let us lift our [D/F#M]voices

Yes [EM7]He has [G]saved our [ASUS]souls  [A] 
And [EM7]of His [G]grace we'll s[C2]ing

His [G2]grace so [D/F#]marvelous so   [EM7]free

Verse 2: 
[D]Once we stood before Him [D/F#]guilty
Condemned by all our [G2]sin
Deserving of His [ASUS]wrath

Through His Son's atoning [ASUS]death  [A] 
And [EM7]He has [G]saved our [ASUS]souls  [A] 
And [EM7]of His [G]grace we'll [C2]sing
