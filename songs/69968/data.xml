		<text>Verse 1:
The blood of Jesus speaks for me
Be still my soul redeeming love
Out of the dust of Calvary
Is rising to the throne above
There is no vengeance in His cry
While it is finished fills the sky
Forgiveness is the final plea
The blood of Jesus speaks for me

Verse 2:
My heart can barely take it in
He pardons all my guilty stains
Surrender all my shame to Him
He breaks the curse of ev'ry chain
My sin is great but greater still
The boundless grace His heart reveals
A mercy deeper than the sea
The blood of Jesus speaks for me

Verse 3:
When my accuser makes the claim
That I should die for my offense
I point him to that rugged frame
Where I found life at Christ's expense
See from His hands His feet His side
The fountain flowing deep and wide
Oh hear it shout the victory
The blood of Jesus speaks for me

Bridge:
Worthy is the Lamb Lamb for sinners slain
Jesus Lord of all glory to His name
Heaven crying out let the earth proclaim
Power in the blood glory to His name
(REPEAT)

Jesus

Verse 4:
Oh let my soul arise and sing
My confidence is not in vain
The One who fights for me is King
His oath His covenant remain
No condemnation now I dread
Eternal hope is mine instead
His Word will stand I stand redeemed
The blood of Jesus speaks for me

Ending:
Amazing love how can it be
The blood of Jesus speaks for me
For me
For me
