		<text>Verse 1:
Just [A]as I am, with[E/A]out one pl[A]ea
But t[E/A]hat Thy b[E7/A]lood was s[D/A]hed for [A]me
And t[A]hat Thou bidst me c[D/A]ome to Thee
O L[A]amb of God, I c[E/A]ome, I c[A]ome   [D/A]              [A]            [D/A]

Verse 2:
Just [A]as I am, and [E/A]waiting n[A]ot
To [E/A]rid my [E7/A]soul of [D/A]one dark b[A]lot
To T[A]hee whose blood can cl[D/A]eanse each spot
O L[A]amb of God, I c[E/A]ome, I c[A]ome   [D/A]              [A]            [D/A]

Chorus:
I come b[F#m]roken to be me[D]nded, I come wo[A]unded to be h[E]ealed
I come de[F#m]sperate to be re[D]scued, I come e[A]mpty to be f[E]illed
I come g[F#m]uilty to be pa[D]rdoned by the b[A]lood of Christ the L[D]amb
And I'm we[D]lcomed with [F#m]open arms
Praise G[D]od, just [E]as I a[A]m      [D/A]              [A]            [D/A]

Verse 3:
Just [A]as I am, I w[E/A]ould be l[A]ost
But m[E/A]ercy and [E7/A]grace my f[D/A]reedom bo[A]ught
And n[A]ow to glory [D/A]in Your cross
O L[A]amb of God, I c[E/A]ome, I c[A]ome   [D/A]              [A]            [D/A]</text>
