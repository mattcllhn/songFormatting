Verse 2:
[E]When the floods are sw[G#m]irling round me, [C#m]You are w[G#m]ith me  [A     E]
And [E]when the flames rise [G#m]all about me, [C#m]they don’t b[G#m]urn me  [A     E]
You’re [A]nearer than the [E]air I’m breathing
Pr[A]omised You would [E]never leave me
[F#m] [ ]You never ch[A]ange [(to chorus)]

Bridge:
So [G#m]I will say it’s [A]good that You affl[G#m]icted me

And to [F#m]trust in You at [B]all times

Opt:

[C#m]You are always faithful
[F#m]Shining like the sun
[A]Rising up with healing in Your wings [(to chorus)]</text>
