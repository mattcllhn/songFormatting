[C#m7]You are highly ex[A2]alted
Name above all n[E]ames, worthy of all pr[B]aise

Jesus, You’re the K[E]ing over everyth[B]ing
Ex[A]alted to the h[E]ighest pl[B]ace
[F#m7]Given the n[A]ame ab[B]ove all other n[C#m7]ames [A    E    B]

Verse 2:
[E]The tomb is empty, Christ has r[A2]isen, [E]Jesus, the Lamb once crucif[A2]ied
[E]The angels never cease to w[A2]orship, Jes[E]us, in heaven glorif[A2]ied
[F#m7]To Him belongs the p[B]ower, the w[E]isdom, m[B/D#]ight, and str[C#m7]ength
[F#m7]All glory and dom[B]inion{,} to the L[C#m7]ord of [A2]every [B]age

Bridge:
Our [A]knees will bow, our [C#m7]tongues proclaim
That [A]You are Lord of [E]all
