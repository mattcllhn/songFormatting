		<text>Intro: 
[A   |   Asus]

VERSE 1: 
[A]Celebrate this happy morning
[Asus]Darkness breaks to glorious day
[A]Day of wonder, day of gladness
[Asus]Look! The stone is [D]rolled [E]away
[A]Hear the angel now proclaiming
[Asus]He's not here, but do not dread
[A]Come and see the tomb is empty
[Asus]Christ is risen [D]from [A]the [E]dead

CHORUS: 
He's a[A]live, He's alive, He's alive
Tell the [F#m7]world Jesus is alive
He's the [D]King of Kings, and Lord of [E]Lords
He's a[A]live, He's alive, He's alive
He has [F#m7]risen with power on High
And with grace [D]He reigns forever [E]more

VERSE 2: 
[A]Death is swallowed up in victory
[Asus]Where O' death, where is your sting
[A]Over Satan and sin's power
[Asus]Christ has won the [D]victo[E]ry
[A]When the Snake sought to destroy Him
[Asus]Jesus crushed the Serpent's head
[A]Hallelujah, it is finished
[Asus]Christ has risen [D]as [A]He [E]said

CHORUS: 
He's a[A]live, He's alive, He's alive
Tell the [F#m7]world Jesus is alive
He's the [D]King of Kings, and Lord of [E]Lords
He's a[A]live, He's alive, He's alive
He has [F#m7]risen with power on High
And with grace [D]He reigns forever [E]more

Bridge: 
You conquered the [D]grave, salvation is [A]won
The power of [E]death is over[F#m7]come  [E] 
You raised me to [D]life, my chains are un[A]done 
Now I am [E]free to come to Your [F#m7]throne  [E] 
[(2nd Time)] Now I am [F#m7]free to [E]come to Your [D]throne</text>
