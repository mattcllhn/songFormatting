		<text>Verse 1:
The [C]Lord is not our equal, He doesn’t [G/B]need the help of man
Who could [Am]ever give Him counsel
Who could [F]ever stop His sovereign plan
Though [C]men may boast of wisdom, and be [G/B]filled with pride within
Who is [Am]bold enough to answer 
When his [F]Maker comes to question [F2]him

Verse 2:
Though [C]rulers rise against Him, the [G/B]King of Heaven laughs
He re[Am]bukes them in His anger, and [F]terrifies them in His wrath
He [C]punishes the wicked, pours [G/B]judgment out on sin
Yet this [Am]Champion of Justice
Is a [F]Savior if you call on [F2]Him

Chorus:
And we call on the [Am]name{,} [G]of the holy [Em]sovereign [F]Lord
The [C]King of [G]all the [F]earth
And we hope in the [Am]pow’r{,} [G]of His awesome [Em]mighty [F]hand
We [C]tremble [G]at His [F2]word, 
Who is like our [Am   G   | Em   F   | Am   G   | F]God

Verse 3:
The [C]heavens sound with thunder, as His [G/B]majesty is shown
The [Am]four and twenty elders{,} fall [F]down and worship at His throne
His [C]eyes are flames of fire, and His [G/B]face is like the sun
He’s the [Am]Alpha and Omega
The [F]One who was and is to [F2]come</text>
