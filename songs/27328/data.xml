		<text>Verse 1:
Your [Bb]Word tells me I have a need
To watch out for my [F]soul
And [Bb]every day it’s clear to me
I [Bb]need Your [F]self-con[Bb]trol
My [Bb]hands and feet are quick to move
Before I even [F]know
So [Bb]Jesus, make me more like You
And [Bb]give me [F]self-con[Bb]trol

Chorus:
[Eb]Lord, [Bb/D]I’m  [Cm7]need[F]y, [Eb]so [Bb/D]I’m  [Fsus]plead[Bb]ing
[Eb]Come [Bb/D]and  [Cm7]fill [F]me,{,} [Eb]help me [Bb/D]to be [F]self-con[Bb]trolled
[Eb]Help me [Bb/D]to be [2/4] [F]self-[4/4]cont[Bb]rolled [| Eb   Bb   | Eb   Bb/D   | F   Bb]

Verse 2:
When [Bb]I say words I shouldn’t speak
And hurt the ones I [F]know
On [Bb]mornings when I’d rather sleep
I [Bb]need Your [F]self-cont[Bb]rol
When [Bb]I am told to sit for hours
And time goes by so [F]slow
I [Bb]need the Holy Spirit’s power
To [Bb]give me [F]self-cont[Bb]rol</text>
