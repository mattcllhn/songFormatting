		<text>Intro:
[Dm9      | Fmaj7]

Verse 1:
How sad our [Am]state by [C] nature is
Our [Dm]sin how deep it [F]stains
When Satan [Am]takes our [C] captive minds
And [Dm]binds us with his [F] chains
But there’s a [Am]voice of sovereign [C]grace, within Your [F]sac[C/E]red [G/D]Word
“Come you [Am]hopeless, lost sinners [C] come, and trust u[F]pon [C/E]the [Dm]Lord”


Verse 2:
My soul o[Am]beys the [C] mighty call
And [Dm]runs to this re[F]lief
I have be[Am]lieved Your [C] promise, Lord
Oh [Dm]help my unbe[F]lief
To the [Am]fountain of Your own [C] blood, Incarnate [F]God, [C/E]I [G/D]fly
Here let me [Am] wash my spotted [C] soul, from crimes of [F]deep[C/E]est [Dm]dye


Verse 3:
Stretch out Your [Am]arm, vic[C]torious King
My [Dm]reigning sins sub[F]due
Defeat the [Am]pride that [C] dwells within
Keep [Dm]Calvary in my [F]view
A guilty, [Am]weak, and helpless [C]soul, into Your [F]hands [C/E]I [G/D]fall
Lord, be my [Am]strength and righteous[C]ness, my Jesus, [F]be [C/E]my [Dm]all (3x)


End:
[Am2     | C2     | Dm2     | Fmaj7     | Am9]</text>
