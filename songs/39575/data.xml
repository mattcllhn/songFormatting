		<text>Intro: 
[C      | G    Am7     | F/C      | G]
Verse 1: 
A [F/C]seed falls [C]down [G]from the [Am7]heights, and is [F/C]buried [C]in the [G]earth
It [F/C]silent[C]ly lies [G]in the g[Am7]round, a[F/C]waiting [C]a re[G]birth
[Am7]So it is with t[Em]hose who die, their [F]lips confessing C[G]hrist
Because He is r[F/C]isen, [G]with Him they will [F/C]rise [C  | F/C  C  | F/C    | G] 

Verse 2: 
[F/C]Shall we [C]mourn as [G]this world [Am7]mourns, or [F/C]shall we [C]rest in tr[G]uth?
Though [F/C]outward[C]ly we [G]waste aw[Am7]ay, with[F/C]in we [C]are ren[G]ewed
The [Am7]weight of glory [Em]far transcends, these [F]momentary [G]trials
Because He is r[F/C]isen, [G]with Him we will [F/C]rise [C  | F/C  C] 
We will [F/C]rise [G] 

Bridge: 
[Am]Weeping may last for an [Em/G]evening
But re[Fmaj7/C]joicing comes with the [C]dawn [G/B] 
[Am]Weeping may last for an [Em/G]evening
But re[Fmaj7/C]joicing comes with the [G]dawn

Verse 3: 
To [F/C]all the [C]wonders [G]God will [Am7]do, i[F/C]magi[C]nation’s b[G]lind
What [F/C]He has [C]made, He’ll [G]make a[Am7]new, in the [F/C]twinkling [C]of an [G]eye
For [Am7]death itself will b[Em]e destroyed, [Fmaj7]swallowed up by l[G]ife
Because He is r[F/C]isen, [G]with Him we will r[F/C]ise [C  |F/C  C] 
We will r[F/C]ise [G  Am  G] 

Tag: 
[F]Because He is r[G]isen, [Am]we will rise with H[G/B]im
Oh, [F/C]we will, we will r[G/C]ise [Am/C], we will r[G/C]ise</text>
		<searchtext>intro verse 1 a seed falls down from the heights and is buried in the earth it silently lies in the ground awaiting a rebirth so it is with those who die their lips confessing christ because he is risen with him they will rise verse 2 shall we mourn as this world mourns or shall we rest in truth though outwardly we waste away within we are renewed the weight of glory far transcends these momentary trials because he is risen with him we will rise we will rise bridge weeping may last for an evening but rejoicing comes with the dawn weeping may last for an evening but rejoicing comes with the dawn verse 3 to all the wonders god will do imaginations blind what he has made hell make anew in the twinkling of an eye for death itself will be destroyed swallowed up by life because he is risen with him we will rise we will rise tag because he is risen we will rise with him oh we will we will rise we will rise</searchtext>
