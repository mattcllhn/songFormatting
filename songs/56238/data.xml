Come and s[Bb]tand before your maker
Full of w[Eb]onder full of fear

Is the [Eb]God who bends to bless us
With an [F]unrelenting love

Chorus: 
[Bb]Rejoice!
Come and [Gm]lift your hands and [Eb]raise your [Bb]voice

We are c[Bb]hildren of the promise
The bel[Eb]oved of the Lord
Won with [Bb]everlasting kindness
Bought with [Eb]sacrificial blood
Bringing [Gm]reconciliation
To a w[F]orld that longs to know
The aff[Eb]ections of a father
Who will [F]never let them go
