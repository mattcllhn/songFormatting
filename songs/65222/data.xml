		<text>Verse 1: 
[A]When I fear my [A/C#]faith will [D]fail, 
[D]Christ will [E]hold me [A]fast;
[A]When the tempter [A/C#]would pre[D]vail, 
[D]He will [E]hold me [A]fast.
[F#m]I could [E/G#]nev[E]er [A]keep my [D]hold 
[D]Through life’s [C#]fearful [F#m]path;
[F#m]For my [E/G#]love [E]is [A]often [D]cold;
[D]He must [E]hold me [A]fast.


Chorus: 
[D]He will [E]hold me [F#m]fast,
[F#m]He will [E/G#]hold me [A]fast;
[A]For my [Bm7]Savior [A/C#]loves me [D]so,
[D]He will [E]hold me [A]fast.


Verse 2: 
[A]Those He saves are [A/C#]His de[D]light,
[D]Christ will [E]hold me [A]fast;
[A]Precious in his [A/C#]holy [D]sight,
[D]He will [E]hold me [A]fast.
[F#m]He’ll not [E/G#]let [E]my [A]soul be [D]lost;
[D]His promis[C#]es shall [F#m]last;
[F#m]Bought by [E/G#]Him [E]at [A]such a [D]cost,
[D]He will [E]hold me [A]fast.

Verse 3: 
[A]For my life He [A/C#]bled and [D]died,
[D]Christ will [E]hold me [A]fast;
[A]Justice has been [A/C#]satis[D]fied;
[D]He will [E]hold me [A]fast.
[F#m]Raised with [E/G#]Him [E]to [A]endless [D]life,
[D]He will [C#]hold me [F#m]fast
[F#m]‘Till our [E/G#]faith [E]is [A]turned to [D]sight,
[D]When He [E]comes at [A]last!
